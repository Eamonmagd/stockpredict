Hedge funds and institutional investors spend millions of dollars on analysts with MBAs and PhDs who are industry experts and well connected to other industry and media insiders on top of that. Individual investors can piggyback the hedge funds employing these talents and can benefit from their vast resources and knowledge in that way. We analyze quarterly 13F filings of nearly 900 hedge funds and by looking at the smart money sentiment that surrounds a stock we can determine whether it has the potential to beat the market over the long-term. Therefore let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at what smart money thinks about Ocugen Inc. (NASDAQ:OCGN).Ocugen Inc.

The company didn't announce any new developments so what's behind this decline? One potential reason relates to Ocugen's inclusion in the Russell 3000 index.So whatOcugen announced a few weeks ago that its shares would be included in the Russell 3000 which tracks the performance of the 3000 largest stocks traded in the U.S. This change took effect as of the market close on June 28.It's probably no coincidence that the biotech stock has fallen since then. Why? Any mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the Russell 3000 had to buy shares of Ocugen with its inclusion in the index. Between the date Ocugen announced that it would join the index and the effective date of the addition its shares soared more than 30%.Image source: Getty Images.Now though most (if not all) of the funds have completed their purchases of Ocugen. The stock is returning to its normal trading without the benefit of the temporary catalyst.Now whatThe main thing to watch with Ocugen is its progress toward winning regulatory approval or authorization for COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. Ocugen's best chances of getting the vaccine on the market in the near term could be in Canada. In early June the company announced the expansion of its commercialization rights with Bharat Biotech the maker of Covaxin to include Canada in addition to the U.S.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

His background includes serving in management and consulting for the healthcare technology health insurance medical device and pharmacy benefits management industries.Follow @keithspeightsMake a lot of money. That's the goal of every investor. The simplest way that gives you the best chances of making money is buying great stocks and holding them for a long time. However some prefer that their returns come much more quickly.One path to generating huge gains in a short amount of time is by scooping up shares of stocks that are great short-squeeze candidates. The idea behind this approach is that stocks that have been heavily sold short will begin to rise causing short-sellers to cover their positions and drive the share prices even higher.Clover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV) and\xc2\xa0Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) are two stocks to consider with this get-rich-quick approach. Which is the better short-squeeze candidate? Here's how Clover Health and Ocugen stack up against each other.Image source: Getty Images.How heavy is the short-selling?The most important ingredient for a potential short-squeeze stock is just how heavily the stock is sold short. It's sort of like how much gasoline has been poured on a woodpile -- the more there is the bigger the flame will be.You could just look at a given stock's short interest which reflects the number of shares sold short that haven't been covered. However the better metric to use is the short percentage of float. Outstanding shares represent all of the shares a company has issued while float is the number of shares that are available for trading. The short percentage of float is calculated by dividing the short interest by the stock float.There's not much of a contest between Clover Health and Ocugen on this metric. Clover Health's short percentage of float is close to 37% compared to only 25.5% for Ocugen.However it's important to note that these figures are as of June 15. Short interest data (which directly impacts the short percentage of float) is only updated twice per month for stocks that trade on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange as both Clover Health and Ocugen do. The number of shares sold short for both stocks has undoubtedly changed over the last couple of weeks.What are the potential catalysts?Using the analogy of the woodpile if the shares sold short are the gasoline on the wood potential catalysts would be the matches used to light the fire. So what are the potential catalysts for Clover Health and Ocugen?Quarterly updates always offer the potential for pleasant surprises. Clover Health would be more likely to benefit from beating top- or bottom-line expectations since it's already generating steady revenue whereas Ocugen isn't. However Clover Health won't report its second-quarter results until August.One potential positive catalyst for Ocugen relates to the expansion of its partnership with Bharat Biotech to include Canada. The Canadian market could actually present a greater opportunity for Ocugen (at least over the near term) than the U.S.It's going to be a while before Ocugen has a shot at winning U.S. regulatory approval for Bharat's COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin. However there's still a possibility that Canada could give the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization. If that happened Ocugen would likely be a textbook short-squeeze stock.Sometimes no external catalyst is needed for a stock to move higher. Other times a stock jumps when you'd normally expect it to fall. For example Clover Health's shares soared last week after the company warned in an amendment to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its stock could be highly volatile and decline significantly.The squeeze and beyondI think Clover Health is the better short-squeeze candidate than Ocugen right now. You're not going to get a stronger hint than when a company warns investors that it could be subject to a short squeeze as Clover Health recently did.Making money from a short squeeze requires paying close attention to a stock's daily and sometimes even minute-by-minute moves. You can profit from a short squeeze but only if you're watching the stock like a hawk. When a short squeeze ends the big gains evaporate. Anyone who doesn't sell quickly enough can be stuck with a stock that trades at a lower price than what they paid.That brings us full circle back to the approach to investing in stocks that's the simplest and gives you the best chance to make money -- buying and holding shares of great companies. This method isn't nearly as exciting as jumping aboard a short-squeeze bandwagon. However for most investors it's a much better way to generate solid returns.Are Clover Health and/or Ocugen smart picks for a buy-and-hold strategy? For now my answer would be no. I think there are many more stocks that offer better risk-reward profiles than either of these potential short-squeeze plays.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Or are the OCGN stock bulls just delusional? In my view you can count on the latter. Any way you slice it this biotech company has little chance of generating big profits \xe2\x80\x94 or even big sales \xe2\x80\x94 from its Covaxin Covid-19 vaccine candidate.Source: ShutterstockAs you may have heard Ocugen\xe2\x80\x99s candidate is out of the running for emergency use authorization (EUA) stateside. Now the company is pursuing full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). True it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that Covaxin gets approved. However at the conclusion of such a lengthy approval process who\xe2\x80\x99s to say there will be much demand for vaccines left in the United States?Admittedly there is another possibility that could play out here however. Ocugen has not only obtained the U.S. rights to Covaxin from Bharat Biotech but it now holds Canadian rights too. And as InvestorPlace\xe2\x80\x99s Brenden Rearick recently reported Canada is lagging in terms of vaccination rates. So the company could enter that market more easily. Yet success in the north may be less attainable than it first appears.The writing is more or less on the wall for OCGN stock. But that fact has not yet completely sunk in with investors. As such if you own this one get out while you still can.OCGN Stock Was a Long Shot from the StartTo be frank Ocugen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmeme stock\xe2\x80\x9d attributes played a big role in its strong performance this year. That is in today\xe2\x80\x99s market conditions where hype and momentum is the name of the game speculators had no trouble giving OCGN stock a high valuation. Its vaccine candidate has been a long shot from the start.Basically the bull case for OCGN stock has never made much sense due mainly to the lack of demand for another vaccine. Now most Americans who wanted a vaccine have received one. There have been plenty of doses to go around from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).And what about the vaccine-hesitant folks? Well most people in that category will likely wait until more employers and institutions make vaccines mandatory. And that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen until the existing ones get full FDA approval.Yes this will open the door for Covaxin as well \xe2\x80\x94 assuming it can also get approval. But even if we see vaccine mandates my gut instinct says that the established vaccines will still have the edge.Covaxin\xe2\x80\x99s Odds in Canada Look SlimSporting a $1.6 billion market capitalization many still have faith that Covaxin will change the game for Ocugen \xe2\x80\x94 especially with the Canadian rights it just attained. However I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this second market will be enough to pick up the slack.With its American EUA dreams dashed can OCGN stock hold onto its value via EUA approval in Canada? Not so fast. Sure the country has seen a slower rollout of vaccines. As of this writing only 29.6% of Canadians are fully vaccinated compared to 47% of Americans.Yet a closer look at the data shows that the gap could soon close given that 67% of Canadians are at least partially vaccinated. And just like the States the top three U.S. vaccines have also been approved for emergency use in Canada as well as Astrazeneca\xe2\x80\x99s (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine.This casts doubt on the idea that Canadian health authorities will put in big orders for Covaxin even if it gets EUA up north. Moreover does Covaxin even have a chance to get EUA there? After all the FDA said thanks but no thanks.Cash Out of OCGN Stock Before Reddit Wakes UpWith now more than a quarter of its outstanding float sold short I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit there may be a squeeze opportunity here. However given the little attention OCGN stock is now getting on Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s r/WallStreetBets don\xe2\x80\x99t hold your breath. Instead those who short this stock will likely profit once the longs concede that the math behind its valuation just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up.So with the bulls grasping for straws what\xe2\x80\x99s the best move today?

In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on June 22 healthcare and cannabis bureau editor and analyst Olivia Zitkus and Fool.com contributor Adria Cimino discuss a piece of brighter news that may help Ocugen in the near term.Olivia Zitkus: Ocugen recently did expand its agreement with Bharat Biotech to include co-commercialization in Canada. It\'s just north of the border. Do you think that will have positive enough impact to make up for the delay in the United States? What do you think about that new expanded agreement?Adria Cimino: Well thank goodness -- that\'s definitely a positive. It came right in time because it gives something positive to focus on. They said that they\'re going to continue with their request for emergency authorization there so it could be pretty quick if that happens according to schedule. Now of course we have to keep in mind that Canada does have to say "yes" to this and they do have to make an order so those are two unknowns. We don\'t know right now if they\'re going to actually authorize the vaccine candidate and if they\'re going to make an order. Now one thing -- Canada has struggled with supply of vaccine. They might be more ready to order vaccines from another player than the U.S. would be because they\'ve had some supply issues. They might be ready to say "Hey we\'re going to try ordering from someone else and see if we can get some more doses." This could be positive for Ocugen definitely. But again there are a lot of "ifs" here. The market in and of itself isn\'t as big as the U.S. market. If you\'re really aiming at the idea of getting the U.S. market -- now getting the Canadian market it\'s a smaller market though it could be a more receptive market. But we\'ll see what happens. But right now I\'d say this is a very risky stock so it\'s good to watch from the sidelines.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

This was a highflier at least through the start of the year. A couple of things have changed. But Ocugen hasn\'t quite made it to the vaccine race finish line yet either but it\'s one a lot of investors have been betting on. It climbed as much as 700% I think earlier this year after signing a deal to co-commercialize Bharat Biotech\'s vaccine candidate in the states but it recently dropped its plan to file for an EUA for Emergency Use Authorization and the stock fell. Why did they do that? Can you explain to us what happened?Adria Cimino: Sure. Well the FDA actually recommended that to Ocugen they recommend that Ocugen file for regular authorization versus an EUA. This really extends the timeline because the EUA as we\'ve seen with Pfizer Moderna and even in Johnson & Johnson was a matter of few weeks from when they applied to when they actually got the authorization. The regular authorization regular approval review usually takes six to 10 months. Of course a longer timeline. Then the FDA also asked for more information. Again that\'s going to add on some time. Ocugen says it may even have to do a new trial. Right now that candidate is in a phase 3 trial in India. What that implies is -- they\'ve already started to report data from that trial -- that implies that that data isn\'t enough and that they\'re going to have to do as they said perhaps a new trial. Again that adds even more time. Really right now I think investors this wasn\'t what they bargained for. They were thinking "this is a close-to-market product it\'s going to be out soon." The stock really rose a whole lot. Now they\'re realizing that well this is something that if it\'s going to be out if it\'s approved at all it\'s going to be a lot later. It\'s a very risky bet right now. We don\'t really have any clarity as far as what is going to happen. If it\'s going to be approved when? The stock is very risky right now.Zitkus: Yeah I can imagine on top of the delay to commercialize the cost of re-upping a brand new clinical trial that\'ll be very significant too right?Cimino: Right.Zitkus: It\'s not just the timeline that\'s the problem.Cimino: Right. That\'s another thing that investors are probably thinking of is what is this going to cost Ocugen to get this to market that\'s another good point.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.
