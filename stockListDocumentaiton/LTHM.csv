Our proprietary scoring system considers the overall health of the company by looking at the stock's price earnings and growth rate to determine if it represents a good value. LTHM holds a better value than 25% of stocks at its current price. Investors who are focused on long-term growth through buy-and-hold investing will find the Valuation Rank especially relevant when allocating their assets.LTHM gets a 25 Valuation Rank today.Find out what this means to you and get the rest of the rankings on LTHM!See Full LTHM ReportMetrics AnalysisLTHM has a trailing twelve month Price to Earnings (PE) ratio of -154.4 which places it below the histroical average of roughly 15. LTHM is currently trading at a good value due to investors paying less than what the stock is worth in relation to its earnings. LTHM's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) of -0.12 does justify its share price in the market. Trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate thus some firms will have high PE ratios caused by high growth recruiting more investors even if the underlying company has produced low earnings so far.LTHM currently has a 12-month-forward-PE-to-Growth (PEG) ratio of 3.47. The market is currently overvaluing LTHM in relation to its projected growth due to the PEG ratio being above the fair market value of 1. LTHM's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. Because PEG ratios include more fundamentals of a company's overall health with additional focus on the future they are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts.SummaryAll together these valuation metrics paint a pretty poor picture for LTHM at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio due to strong growth. The PE and PEG for LTHM are worse than the average of the market resulting in a valuation score of 25.Click Here to get the full Stock Score Report on Livent Corp (LTHM) Stock.Share this article:Related Articles-- TSX Open Brief: Set To Close Up More Than 20 Pts and Above 20300 Level After Afternoon Rebound For Fresh Record All Time HighsTuesday July 06 2021 03:59 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: Energy Stocks Slump Following 3% Decline in Global Oil PricesTuesday July 06 2021 03:42 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: EnergyTuesday July 06 2021 03:29 PM | MT NewswiresCanada Markets SummaryTuesday July 06 2021 03:20 PM | MT NewswiresNational Bank Monthly Equity Monitor For July/August 2021Tuesday July 06 2021 03:07 PM | MT NewswiresIs ArcelorMittal SA (MT) Stock a Attractive Value?Tuesday July 06 2021 02:10 PM | InvestorsObserver AnalystsRelated CompaniesLTHMYou May Also LikeRelated Articles-- TSX Open Brief: Set To Close Up More Than 20 Pts and Above 20300 Level After Afternoon Rebound For Fresh Record All Time HighsTuesday July 06 2021 03:59 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: Energy Stocks Slump Following 3% Decline in Global Oil PricesTuesday July 06 2021 03:42 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: EnergyTuesday July 06 2021 03:29 PM | MT NewswiresCanada Markets SummaryTuesday July 06 2021 03:20 PM | MT NewswiresNational Bank Monthly Equity Monitor For July/August 2021Tuesday July 06 2021 03:07 PM | MT NewswiresIs ArcelorMittal SA (MT) Stock a Attractive Value?Tuesday July 06 2021 02:10 PM | InvestorsObserver AnalystsRelated CompaniesLTHMContact413-A East Main StreetCharlottesville VA 22902US: +1 800 698 9101International: +1 434 293 9100StocksStocks DashboardTop 5 StocksStock ScreenerOptionsOptions DashboardOptions PortfoliosOptions Trade ScreenerAccount and SupportMy AccountAbout UsNewslettersContact UsHelp CenterReviewsEmail Whitelist InstructionsStock Price data may be delayed up to 15 minutes.Copyright \xc2\xa9 2021.

Our proprietary scoring system considers the overall health of the company by looking at the stock's price earnings and growth rate to determine if it represents a good value. LTHM holds a better value than 25% of stocks at its current price. Investors who are focused on long-term growth through buy-and-hold investing will find the Valuation Rank especially relevant when allocating their assets.LTHM gets a 25 Valuation Rank today.Find out what this means to you and get the rest of the rankings on LTHM!See Full LTHM ReportMetrics AnalysisLTHM has a trailing twelve month Price to Earnings (PE) ratio of -154.4 which places it below the histroical average of roughly 15. LTHM is currently trading at a good value due to investors paying less than what the stock is worth in relation to its earnings. LTHM's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) of -0.12 does justify its share price in the market. Trailing PE ratios do not factor in the company's projected growth rate thus some firms will have high PE ratios caused by high growth recruiting more investors even if the underlying company has produced low earnings so far.LTHM currently has a 12-month-forward-PE-to-Growth (PEG) ratio of 3.47. The market is currently overvaluing LTHM in relation to its projected growth due to the PEG ratio being above the fair market value of 1. LTHM's PEG comes from its forward price to earnings ratio being divided by its growth rate. Because PEG ratios include more fundamentals of a company's overall health with additional focus on the future they are one of the most used valuation metrics by analysts.SummaryAll together these valuation metrics paint a pretty poor picture for LTHM at its current price due to a overvalued PEG ratio due to strong growth. The PE and PEG for LTHM are worse than the average of the market resulting in a valuation score of 25.Click Here to get the full Stock Score Report on Livent Corp (LTHM) Stock.Share this article:Related Articles-- TSX Open Brief: Set To Close Up More Than 20 Pts and Above 20300 Level After Afternoon Rebound For Fresh Record All Time HighsTuesday July 06 2021 03:59 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: Energy Stocks Slump Following 3% Decline in Global Oil PricesTuesday July 06 2021 03:42 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: EnergyTuesday July 06 2021 03:29 PM | MT NewswiresCanada Markets SummaryTuesday July 06 2021 03:20 PM | MT NewswiresNational Bank Monthly Equity Monitor For July/August 2021Tuesday July 06 2021 03:07 PM | MT NewswiresIs ArcelorMittal SA (MT) Stock a Attractive Value?Tuesday July 06 2021 02:10 PM | InvestorsObserver AnalystsRelated CompaniesLTHMYou May Also LikeRelated Articles-- TSX Open Brief: Set To Close Up More Than 20 Pts and Above 20300 Level After Afternoon Rebound For Fresh Record All Time HighsTuesday July 06 2021 03:59 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: Energy Stocks Slump Following 3% Decline in Global Oil PricesTuesday July 06 2021 03:42 PM | MT NewswiresSector Update: EnergyTuesday July 06 2021 03:29 PM | MT NewswiresCanada Markets SummaryTuesday July 06 2021 03:20 PM | MT NewswiresNational Bank Monthly Equity Monitor For July/August 2021Tuesday July 06 2021 03:07 PM | MT NewswiresIs ArcelorMittal SA (MT) Stock a Attractive Value?Tuesday July 06 2021 02:10 PM | InvestorsObserver AnalystsRelated CompaniesLTHMContact413-A East Main StreetCharlottesville VA 22902US: +1 800 698 9101International: +1 434 293 9100StocksStocks DashboardTop 5 StocksStock ScreenerOptionsOptions DashboardOptions PortfoliosOptions Trade ScreenerAccount and SupportMy AccountAbout UsNewslettersContact UsHelp CenterReviewsEmail Whitelist InstructionsStock Price data may be delayed up to 15 minutes.Copyright \xc2\xa9 2021.
