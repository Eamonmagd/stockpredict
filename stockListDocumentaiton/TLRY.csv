Since the merger announcement TLRY stock and APHA shares have gone in different directions due to the merger arbitrage opportunity.Source: Jarretera / Shutterstock.comWhen the Aphria-Tilray merger was announced back in mid-December both pot stocks exploded.In terms of revenue the combination will create the biggest cannabis company in the world. So the enthusiasm surrounding the merger makes sense.In the year thus far Aphria stock is up 135.3% and TLRY gained 139.2%. Under the terms of the deal Aphria stockholders will receive 62% of the combined entity.Some made money by buying Aphria and shorting Tilray. However at this point the more interesting discussion is whether the combined entity will have the legs to run in an ailing industry.It has been struggling due to the Canadian cannabis market going through an essential round of bubble bursting.On that end I believe the merger ultimately creates an interesting stock that has a much better chance of competing in the Canadian cannabis sector while keeping an eye on the U.S. market.TLRY Stock Suffered With Cannabis SectorLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it. Before this merger was announced both Tilray and the wider cannabis segment were suffering. Gross margin operating margin net margin return on assets return on equity and ROIC is all in the red for TLRY.According to Refinitiv data the Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company has disappointed Wall Street analysts\xe2\x80\x99 consensus earnings estimates 10 times in the last 12 quarters. The company recently reported a negative EPS of 45 cents versus a consensus of negative 14.7 a miss of 206.1%.There are some bright spots though. For the full year 2020 total revenue jumped 26% to $210.5 million driven by international medical revenue and growth in its Canadian adult-use business.Out of the two companies Aphria is clearly the better company on operating metrics. Sales rose 235.8% over the last five years at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Growth in the top line hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated to profitability as yet. But on every major operating metric the company is doing better than Tilray.APHA Stock Maintains Upper HandNo surprises Aphria has the upper hand in this deal. Shareholders will get a total of 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each of their Aphria shares and control the combined entity.Aphria\xe2\x80\x99s and Tilray\xe2\x80\x99s share prices will diverge in the run-up to the merger due to the market arbitrage opportunity. Basically a market arbitrage opportunity is when you simultaneously buy and sell securities to take advantage of a price difference.Usually when a merger is announced the target company\xe2\x80\x99s share price rises. The opposite occurs in the case of the acquiring company. The acquiring company has to pay a premium to purchase the target company often using debt to finance the acquisition.Combined Entity Will Be a Strong European PlayerAfter the merger the surviving entity will become the biggest cannabis company globally in terms of revenue.Wider marijuana decriminalization in the U.S. is imminent. Democrats have unified control of the White House Senate and House for the first time since 2010.At the moment neither Aphria nor Tilray has a strong American presence. In contrast the European medicinal cannabis market and the Canadian recreational market represent the company\xe2\x80\x99s strongest market segments.That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a splash in the U.S. though. With greater size and scale it can make further inroads into the American market since that is the major lifeline for most cannabis aspirants at the moment.Although it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly large the Canadian market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold a candle to the California weed industry let alone the entire U.S.Hence the foray into America is a given and with the combination the merged entity has a better chance of performing well in the market.Bottom Line on Tilray StockFor now investors should keep taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. In the last three months alone shares have increased by 90%. During the same time Tilray stock is up 74.7%. The divergence will increase as we move closer to the merger.If you are bullish on the merger you can hold onto APHA stock post the combination. But I would take my profits after the merger closes and wait for a couple of earnings reports before deciding to put your capital back into the company.On the date of publication Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel.

The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoBloombergArgentina\xe2\x80\x99s Peso Mess Is Delivering Windfall Profits to Brokers(Bloomberg) -- In Argentina financial markets are all but dead. From stocks to bonds to traditional foreign-exchange venues trading volumes are razor thin after the government slapped on rigid currency restrictions in the lead up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s debt default.Except that is in one unusual corner of markets. There brokerages are doing a bustling business -- and raking in record profits -- by handling the types of arcane transactions that Argentines use to convert pesos into dollars and circumvent the limits the government placed on obtaining foreign currencies. At least five firms reported income surges of 500% or more last year with one of them a large shop called Allaria Ledesma posting a 2200% increase.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going through a boom\xe2\x80\x9d said Julio Merlini the chief executive officer of Balanz Capital which has doubled its client base and boosted its workforce by more than half since the controls were imposed in 2019. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople stopped investing in mutual funds and timed deposits and are dollarizing portfolios.\xe2\x80\x9dBut as Argentines eschew traditional investments to focus on converting their assets to dollars before the peso weakens even further banks are forbidden from operating in the so-called blue-chip swap markets used to get foreign currency. That helped lead the sector to its worst performance in 13 years. A steady stream of bankers have left to join brokerages since the restrictions were put in place in 2019 with Merlini estimating they can earn about 50% more in their new jobs.It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the fallout from former President Mauricio Macri\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose capital controls amid a rush for the doors after the political opposition won a key primary in 2019. The move left foreign investors with no easy way to get their money out of the country and crimped the ability of Argentines to buy dollars leaving them to either watch the value of their peso savings tumble amid rampant inflation or seek an escape in the blue-chip swap.Called the contado con liquidacion in Spanish the swap has been around for almost two decades in Argentina with use peaking when restrictions are dialed up and the peso\xe2\x80\x99s prospects deteriorate. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually undertaken by buying peso assets locally and then selling them abroad for dollars creating an exchange rate that\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 38% weaker than the official one.It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of parallel rates that have taken hold in Argentina amid the economic turmoil of the past few years. The country has been rocked by a 60% drop for the peso since the end of 2018 a $60 billion default by the federal government and the worst economic collapse since 2002 last year amid one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s strictest pandemic lockdowns.As the blue-chip swap took off more typical financial transactions have seen reduced volumes. Financial entities traded a daily average of $167 million in the spot foreign-exchange market last year down 67% from a year earlier. Fixed-income volume in the Mercado Abierto Electronico which is owned by banks fell by more than half to $96 billion.At the Argentine Stock Exchange mostly the domain of brokers fixed-income volumes jumped 57% in 2020 to $247 billion.The shifts have propelled a surge in bank departures as investment professionals seek out higher wages and less regulatory scrutiny. At least a dozen prominent bankers have made the switch since mid-2019 including HSBC Plc trader Juan Manuel Truppia\xe2\x80\x99s jump to TPCG Valores. Other high-profile moves include Manuel Rocha-Nan\xe2\x80\x99s switch from head of corporate sales at Banco Galicia to Max Capital and Carolina Gialdi a fixed-income strategist at BTG Pactual who also joined Max Capital.\xe2\x80\x9cThe brokers today are fed by the banks\xe2\x80\x9d said Juan Rodriguez Braun a partner at Max Capital which increased its workforce by 25% in 2020 to 50 employees. Making the move \xe2\x80\x9coffers higher remuneration associated with the results of the company.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.4h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Life Insurance CoverWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdBrits Rush To Take Out Up To \xc2\xa3291k Life Insurance*Cheaper life insurance policies are available now.

A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d agoCoinDeskBitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in SiberiaMining company BitRiver is launching its own token aiming to raise $35 million on Bithumb2d agoMore Stories', b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tilray-inc-tlry-gains-lags-215009153.html'

The shares have gone from $9 to $17 \xe2\x80\x93 bringing the market capitalization to $3 billion.Source: Jarretera / Shutterstock.comBut of course in February TLRY stock went parabolic as Reddit traders got interested in the shares along with a group of other names like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment\xc2\xa0(NYSE:AMC). The high was $67. A big catalyst was the election of President Joe Biden.But as things have cooled off what now for TLRY stock? Is now a good time for a buy? Well I think so. Tilray does look poised to benefit from the secular trends in the industry.Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look.The AdvantagesPerhaps the most important catalyst for Tilray is the transformative merger with rival Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). The deal was announced in mid-December.7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10The current CEO of Aphria Irwin Simon will become the CEO of the new entity (which will be called Tilray). This is certainly good news. Keep in mind that Simon has more than three decades of business experience. For example he founded Hain Celestial Group (NASDAQ:HAIN) which is a leader in organic and natural products. The revenues are over $3 billion.Now of course the deal will provide substantial cost synergies because of the duplications across the two organizations. The estimate is for 100 million CAD within two years.Yet there have already been cut backs by Tilray and Aphria. The companies have had to streamline their organizations as the Canadian market has gotten more competitive.Now another key factor for this deal is the scale. To remain competitive in the cannabis industry there needs to be a cost advantage. There also needs to be a portfolio of premium brands.And yes as for the new Tilray it will have all this. The deal will result in a company that has the leading market share in the Canadian market. As for the brands there will be plenty of top ones like Riff Good Supply B!ngo Solei Grail Dubon Canaca and The Batch.The new Tilray will also be a diversified business. Note that the medical segment offers considerable potential growth in the years ahead. For example Aphria has a substantial presence in the German market where there is distribution across over 13000 pharmacies. Regarding Tilray it has a strong medical business in Portugal. The company operates a 2.7 million square foot EU-GMP low-coast cultivation and production facility.Then what about the U.S. market? It certainly represents an enormous opportunity although investors should still tamper expectations. While the Biden administration will likely be favorable to the cannabis industry the fact is that the focus is primarily on dealing with the pandemic and the infrastructure bill.Yet despite this it does seem like there will ultimately be some form of legalization in the U.S. After all many states have already passed favorable cannabis laws.As for the new Tilray it should be positioned to benefit. Consider that it has a variety of assets that can be leveraged in the U.S. such as SweetWater Brewing (a craft beer manufacturer and distributor) that has a presence in 27 states. Then there is U.S. Hemp and Wellness. It currently has a distribution in about 17000 stores.Bottom Line On TLRY StockAll in all the cannabis space is likely to remain volatile. But the long-term prospects do look bright. According to analysis from BDSA the market is expected to reach $55.9 billion by 2026 \xe2\x80\x93 for a compound annual growth rate of 17%.But when investing in this category it seems like the best approach is to focus on top operators that have scale. And the new Tilray will certainly be among this group.On the date of publication Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology including Artificial Intelligence Basics High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.\xe2\x80\xaf He is also the founder of\xc2\xa0WebIPO which was one of the first platforms for public offerings during the 1990s.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/the-aphria-merger-will-change-everything-for-tlry-stock/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

Yet despite these possible catalysts this remains a pot play to avoid. As you may know I am very bullish on the cannabis sector at-large. Through my Cannabis Cash Weekly Service I recommend which names in this sector offer the best opportunity.But in the case of this pot play I believe the best move is to pass. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst cannabis stock out there. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not one of the strongest contenders.

Another one has been this stock\xe2\x80\x99s popularity among traders especially those active on Reddit.This popularity resulted in TLRY stock going on a roller-coaster ride back in February. As you may recall the stock went from around $19 per share to as much as $67 per share only to give up most of these gains by month\xe2\x80\x99s end. However don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a second round.Why? This temporary surge had to do with the stock being heavily shorted by merger arbitrageurs. With its pending merger an all-stock deal they shorted this stock and went long its acquisition target. With a sudden increase in demand from Reddit traders naturally the stock made an outsized upward move.So with the \xe2\x80\x9cReddit trade\xe2\x80\x9d long over with will this upcoming merger help put more points into shares? It\xe2\x80\x99s possible but not very likely in the near term.This deal could work out for Tilray. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a \xe2\x80\x9cwait and see\xe2\x80\x9d situation. That is investors will likely not jump back in the stock until there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the deal paying off. In short while a possible catalyst in the long term this upcoming deal won\xe2\x80\x99t do much else to help the stock in the short term.Tilray Is a Lackluster Legalization PlayThe jury may still be out whether its headline-making merger will create shareholder value. But admittedly the legalization catalyst could help boost the stock once again over the next year. Recreational marijuana may now be legal in many U.S. states. But on the federal level it\xe2\x80\x99s still a controlled substance.Sure changes may look set to happen. With the Democratic party controlling both the White House and the U.S. Congress they have the power to implement major reforms. The problem? Even within the party there\xe2\x80\x99s still debate over how much change should happen.The U.S. Senate under the leadership of Chuck Schumer wants to legalize it completely. But President Biden while supportive of decriminalization remains on the fence about full legalization. Not only that for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris more pressing matters have made this a secondary issue. Putting it simply U.S. legalization is still very much a work-in-progress.The specter of legalization taking longer than expected is why patience is key when it comes to cannabis plays. The time will come where commercial production of marijuana becomes a fully legal regulated business in the United States. But with scores of stronger pot stocks to choose from why go with TLRY stock for legalization exposure?There Are Better Opportunities Out ThereThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with Tilray. There are other pot companies in much worse shape. But like I discussed back in December nothing stands out with this particular pot stock. Even after looking at its full-year results (released back on Feb. 17) things haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed a whole lot. Sure the company\xe2\x80\x99s adjusted EBITDA is now finally above breakeven. These numbers will further improve once the merger closes.Yet other cannabis companies are already much further ahead when it comes to profitability. Sales are growing at a decent clip (helped mainly by a big surge in medicinal sales outside its home market of Canada). But this growth pales in comparison to the levels of growth seen with other names. And of course you could buy this stock as a play on U.S. legalization. But some of its better-capitalized rivals stand a greater chance of dominating this market once it opens up.Bottom line: with better opportunities out there skip out on TLRY stock.On the date of publication neither Matt McCall nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in the article.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to\xe2\x80\xafactually help\xc2\xa0investors \xe2\x80\x94 by getting them into the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.\xc2\xa0Click here to see what Matt has up his sleeve now.Matt McCallEditor MoneyWireMeet Matt McCallWith his next-generation approach to investing Matt McCall finds better stocks for you to invest in \xe2\x80\x94 not the same old companies over-hyped on Wall Street.Learn more about MattArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/04/catalysts-aside-tilray-tlry-stock-remains-a-cannabis-name-to-avoid/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCMore from Matt McCallMarket Insight Financial ArticlesDon\xe2\x80\x99t Miss My Favorite Semiconductor StocksBy Matt McCallApr 13 2021UncategorizedThe Chip Stocks You Should Be Keeping an Eye OnBy Matt McCallApr 13 2021Stocks to SellDespite the Rally in Exxon Mobil Stock Continue to Avoid ItBy Matt McCall and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 12 2021ADVERTISEMENTMatt's Most PopularHot StocksDon\xe2\x80\x99t Miss This Chance for Life-Changing Profits With Small High-Growth StocksHot StocksEvery Investor Should Own at Least Some of These StocksHot StocksWhat Square\xe2\x80\x99s $50 Million Bitcoin Investment Means for YouHot StocksThis Bill Gates-Backed Company Is Making Big Waves in the Battery WorldHot Stocks5G Stocks: This New Era of Massive Profits Just BeganContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

The stock's sharp rise and fall was due in part to the efforts of the r/WallStreetBets community who targeted a number of stocks with high short interest as well as\xc2\xa0the election of Joe Biden as U.S. president that could give a lift to\xc2\xa0legalization sentiment.The Tilray Chart: Tilray had been trading in a bearish descending triangle since Feb. 16. This means that it was making lower highs within the pattern but maintaining a low of about $20.80.During the eight weeks Tilray traded in a descending triangle it has failed to make any significant bullish patterns on smaller time frames and so has been unable to break up out of the larger bearish pattern.With the apex of the triangle set to hit by the end of Thursday's trading session sellers came in Wednesday morning and Tilray\xe2\x80\x99s chart broke bearish.See also: How to Buy Tilray Here\xc2\xa0(ACB) StockThe Potential Trades:\xc2\xa0Bears could wait for Tilray to pop back up retest and reject the lower horizontal trendline to enter a short position. Bulls will want to wait for a significant bullish pattern to develop on a shorter timeframe to attempt going long.Why Things Could Turn Around For Tilray: On a positive note the bearish volume on Tilray\xe2\x80\x99s chart has been decreasing which could indicate there is a less amount of selling taking place. If positive news such as the passing of the SAFE Banking Act were to come out Tilray\xe2\x80\x99s stock could reverse and negate the bearish pattern.Tilray is also set to complete its merger with Aphria Inc (NASDAQ:APHA) this quarter which could change the bearish sentiment on the stock.\xc2\xa9 2020 Benzinga.com.

His background includes serving in management and consulting for the healthcare technology health insurance medical device and pharmacy benefits management industries.Follow @keithspeightsWhat happenedSeveral cannabis stocks slid lower on Wednesday. Shares of Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) were down 6.4% as of 3:19 p.m. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock was falling 6.7%. Charlotte's Web Holdings (OTC:CWBHF) shares were tumbling 6.4%. Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock was slipping 5.7%. Other top pot stocks were posting smaller declines.When so many stocks in the same industry sink there's usually a common denominator. In this case one potential culprit is Vice President Kamala Harris' comments in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle published yesterday. The vice president stated that the Biden administration has been too busy with other priorities to address marijuana decriminalization or other major cannabis reforms. This relegation of cannabis-related efforts to the back burner could be increasing investors' doubts that any action will be forthcoming in the near future.However marijuana stocks really began to slide on Wednesday after Natalie Fertig with Politico tweeted that the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has been meeting with various cannabis advocacy groups to discuss cannabis regulations. Investors could be more worried about the possibility that cannabis reform measures won't meet expectations than they are that no reform will happen at all.Image source: Getty Images.So whatWhat does all of this really mean? Nothing.Concerns that the Biden administration won't fulfill its campaign pledge to decriminalize marijuana are premature. After all President Biden has been in office less than three months. Worries about what final regulations might look like if significant cannabis reform moves forward are also a waste of time. It's better to wait to see what changes are ultimately proposed.More than anything what we're seeing with cannabis stocks today reflects their inherent volatility. These stocks tend to swing either higher or lower on mere speculation.You probably noticed that most of the stocks falling the hardest are Canadian cannabis producers -- Aphria Aurora Cannabis and Tilray. These companies are especially anxious about the opportunity to enter the lucrative U.S. cannabis market.Charlotte's Web on the other hand is already a leader in the U.S. hemp CBD market. However the company hopes to expand into the marijuana market once cannabis is legalized at the federal level.Now whatThe best thing that investors can do right now is to wait and see what happens with regard to U.S. cannabis reform. In the meantime the U.S. cannabis market continues to expand even without changes at the federal level. Several U.S. multistate cannabis operators are already benefiting from this growth.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.
