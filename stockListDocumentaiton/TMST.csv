The Dow declined 0.16% (or about 55 points) to 33745.40. Both of these indices established record highs last Friday. The NASDAQ slipped 0.36% (or about 50 points) to 13850.One of the stocks going against the malaise today was graphics chip pioneer NVIDIA (NVDA) which jumped more than 5.6% after announcing its first CPU and an encouraging revenue outlook. Other big news on Monday was Microsoft (MSFT) making its second-biggest acquisition ever by picking up AI & speech technology company Nuance Communications (NUAN) for nearly $20 billion in an all-cash transaction. MSFT was only up 0.02% but NUAN soared nearly 16%.But overall it was another quiet session. The slow trade we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing for the past several sessions continued though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the indices from securing solid performances last week. The NASDAQ jumped 3.1% in the previous five sessions while the S&P was up 2.7% and the Dow increased 2%.Now it\xe2\x80\x99s finally time to start earnings season. Investors are feeling pretty good after the recent jobs report and really appreciate Fed Chair Powell\xe2\x80\x99s continued promises of super accommodation. And this feeling of optimism includes expectations for the first quarter.As Sheraz Mian said in his recent article titled \xe2\x80\x9cLooking Ahead to Big Banks\xe2\x80\x99 Q1 Earnings\xe2\x80\x9d; he sees earnings growth of 20.4% for the quarter and revenue growth of 5.6%.The season unofficially gets started on Wednesday when JPMorgan (JPM) goes to the plate along with Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Other major financial names will be reporting in the following two days before earnings season really picks up the pace next week.Today\'s Portfolio Highlights:Technology Innovators: It\xe2\x80\x99s always fun when one of your portfolio positions becomes profitable because Wall Street will suddenly pay it a lot more attention. That\xe2\x80\x99s why Brian added Upwork (UPWK) on Monday. This provider of online recruitment services topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past two quarters. Most importantly though the recent beat was a penny profit that topped expectations by nearly 115%. Rising earnings estimates for this year and next made UPWK a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Estimates for 2021 are still at a loss but it has narrowed significantly in the past several weeks. The editor was most encouraged by expectations for topline growth of 25% this year and more than 22% for next. Read the full write-up for a lot more on this new addition including an overview of all positions in the portfolio. By the way this service had a couple of the biggest performances on Monday with Criteo S.A. (CRTO +4.5%) and Tesla (TSLA +3.7%).Surprise Trader: Usually Dave doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like buying huge household names for this portfolio since smaller-cap stocks have more room to run. But he\xe2\x80\x99s making an exception for Goldman Sachs (GS)... and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why. The financial powerhouse is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a space (Financial \xe2\x80\x93 Investment Bank) in the top 2% of the Zacks Industry Rank. It has a VGM Composite Score of \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d as well. In addition to this trifecta GS also has a positive Earnings ESP of 3.83% for the quarterly report scheduled before the bell on Wednesday April 14. The editor added GS on Monday with a 12.5% allocation while also selling the rest of Rent-A-Center (RCII) for a 12.5% return in under six weeks. See the complete commentary for more.Income Investor: You might think that a pharma giant like AbbVie (ABBV) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have many opportunities for significant growth... but Maddy begs to differ. The company\xe2\x80\x99s Humira arthritis drug continues finding new revenue flows while there are promising drugs in the pipeline like Rinvoq and Skyrizi. However the editor was most impressed with its \xe2\x80\x9centicing\xe2\x80\x9d yield of 4.8% and a valuation that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctoo cheap to ignore\xe2\x80\x9d. Maddy added ABBV on Monday and sold Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for 14.5%. JNJ is still a great name but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have as \xe2\x80\x9cjuicy\xe2\x80\x9d of a dividend. See the full write-up for more.Options Trader: April options expire this Friday so Kevin made several moves on Monday to give a few positions more time. First of all the portfolio sold to close the April 100.00 Call in Yum! (YUM) for a 135.6% return. Having doubled the premium as planned the editor bought to open an October 115.00 Call. He also sold to close April options in SS&C (SSNC) and Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG) for losses but is giving them more opportunities by buying to open October Calls for each. Finally Lennox (LII) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about an impending expiration since it has a June Call but the premium has doubled. Therefore Kevin sold to close that June 310.00 Call for a 153.7% return and reinvested by buying to open a September 360.00 Call. Read the full write-up for specifics on all of today\xe2\x80\x99s moves.Black Box Trader: The portfolio cashed in a huge winner as part of this week\'s adjustment which included three changes in total and two double-digit profits. The stocks that were sold today included:\xe2\x80\xa2 Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF +54.3%) \xe2\x80\xa2 Timken Steel (TMST +12%) \xe2\x80\xa2 Santander Consumer USA (SC +8.6%)The new buys that replaced these names were:\xe2\x80\xa2 ConocoPhillips (COP) \xe2\x80\xa2 Dow (DOW) \xe2\x80\xa2 ExxonMobil (XOM)Read the Black Box Trader\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to learn more about this computer-driven service.Headline Trader: "There is an extreme amount of optimism baked into this market right now and this week we will begin to find out if the market\'s euphoric valuations are justified. I have no doubt that we will get mixed results between sectors with disappointments and elation being balanced through the next month of quarterly results either confirming optimistic price action or catalyzing a correction in the seemingly stretched markets."There is so much positivity in the equity markets today that it makes me nervous. The primary thing to focus on during this upcoming earnings season is going to be forward guidance. Many companies will likely continue to abstain from providing this because of the still-elevated levels of uncertainty in the economy. When it is provided I suspect it will be market moving for those stocks."Earnings beats are expected as a bare minimum with market euphoria peaking going into Q1 earnings. Any misses could be devastating for share prices. A beat may not even be enough with investors & traders ready to pull the sell trigger at the first sign of weakness at these stretched levels. Don\'t be surprised if you see some profit-pulling on earnings beats especially from this week\'s financial reports with the big banks having had a glorious rally over the past 6 months." -- Dan LaboeUntil Tomorrow Jim GiaquintoRecommendations from Zacks\' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

These contracts are to provide IT and cybersecurity workforce development services under the H-1B One Workforce Grant Program.

Walmart Inc. Apple Inc. and hundreds of other companies are asking President Joe Biden to update the U.S. pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% arguing that the future of the economy is at stake if climate change isn\xe2\x80\x99t adequately addressed.The letter to Biden was signed by 310 companies and comes as the administration prepares a new target to show the rest of the world that the U.S. is serious about confronting climate change after four years of inaction by Donald Trump. People familiar with the deliberations said last week that the White House was considering a target of 50% or higher reductions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.QuickTake: Why the World Awaits Biden\xe2\x80\x99s Pledge on Climate ChangeThe U.S. is on its way to satisfying a target set under former President Barack Obama who vowed to reduce planet-warming emissions from 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of the Paris climate pact. Signatories to the 2015 Paris pact are scheduled to reconvene in November in Scotland and pledge reductions through 2030.But the businesses which also included McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s Corp. and the Coca-Cola Company argue that cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 is attainable.\xe2\x80\x9cTo restore the standing of the U.S. as a global leader we need to address the climate crisis at the pace and scale it demands\xe2\x80\x9d the companies added. \xe2\x80\x9cA bold 2030 target is needed to catalyze a zero-emissions future spur a robust economic recovery create millions of well-paying jobs and allow the U.S. to \xe2\x80\x98build back better\xe2\x80\x99 from the pandemic.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Biden administration is expected to unveil its new climate target before an international climate summit it is convening in Washington later this month. An aggressive target part of a White House push to encourage worldwide action to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels would require broad action to clamp down on planet-warming pollution from power plants automobiles oil wells and agriculture.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you raise the bar on our national ambition we will raise our own ambition to move the U.S. forward on this journey\xe2\x80\x9d the companies said in the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile an effective national climate strategy will require all of us you alone can set the course by swiftly establishing a bold U.S. 2030 target.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.1d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Fisher Investments UKWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAd4 Ways to Retire Comfortably With \xc2\xa3250kHow long will your portfolio last in retirement?

His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoBloombergArgentina\xe2\x80\x99s Peso Mess Is Delivering Windfall Profits to Brokers(Bloomberg) -- In Argentina financial markets are all but dead. From stocks to bonds to traditional foreign-exchange venues trading volumes are razor thin after the government slapped on rigid currency restrictions in the lead up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s debt default.Except that is in one unusual corner of markets. There brokerages are doing a bustling business -- and raking in record profits -- by handling the types of arcane transactions that Argentines use to convert pesos into dollars and circumvent the limits the government placed on obtaining foreign currencies. At least five firms reported income surges of 500% or more last year with one of them a large shop called Allaria Ledesma posting a 2200% increase.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going through a boom\xe2\x80\x9d said Julio Merlini the chief executive officer of Balanz Capital which has doubled its client base and boosted its workforce by more than half since the controls were imposed in 2019. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople stopped investing in mutual funds and timed deposits and are dollarizing portfolios.\xe2\x80\x9dBut as Argentines eschew traditional investments to focus on converting their assets to dollars before the peso weakens even further banks are forbidden from operating in the so-called blue-chip swap markets used to get foreign currency. That helped lead the sector to its worst performance in 13 years. A steady stream of bankers have left to join brokerages since the restrictions were put in place in 2019 with Merlini estimating they can earn about 50% more in their new jobs.It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the fallout from former President Mauricio Macri\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose capital controls amid a rush for the doors after the political opposition won a key primary in 2019. The move left foreign investors with no easy way to get their money out of the country and crimped the ability of Argentines to buy dollars leaving them to either watch the value of their peso savings tumble amid rampant inflation or seek an escape in the blue-chip swap.Called the contado con liquidacion in Spanish the swap has been around for almost two decades in Argentina with use peaking when restrictions are dialed up and the peso\xe2\x80\x99s prospects deteriorate. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually undertaken by buying peso assets locally and then selling them abroad for dollars creating an exchange rate that\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 38% weaker than the official one.It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of parallel rates that have taken hold in Argentina amid the economic turmoil of the past few years. The country has been rocked by a 60% drop for the peso since the end of 2018 a $60 billion default by the federal government and the worst economic collapse since 2002 last year amid one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s strictest pandemic lockdowns.As the blue-chip swap took off more typical financial transactions have seen reduced volumes. Financial entities traded a daily average of $167 million in the spot foreign-exchange market last year down 67% from a year earlier. Fixed-income volume in the Mercado Abierto Electronico which is owned by banks fell by more than half to $96 billion.At the Argentine Stock Exchange mostly the domain of brokers fixed-income volumes jumped 57% in 2020 to $247 billion.The shifts have propelled a surge in bank departures as investment professionals seek out higher wages and less regulatory scrutiny.

GuruFocus Value is GuruFocus' estimate of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. It is calculated based on the historical multiples that the stock has traded at the past business growth and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand if it is significantly below the GF Value Line its future return will likely be higher. At its current price of $13.87 per share and the market cap of $633.9 million TimkenSteel stock appears to be significantly overvalued. GF Value for TimkenSteel is shown in the chart below.Because TimkenSteel is significantly overvalued the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Investing in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. TimkenSteel has a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.11 which is better than 73% of the companies in Steel industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of TimkenSteel at 4 out of 10 which indicates that the financial strength of TimkenSteel is poor. This is the debt and cash of TimkenSteel over the past years: Companies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. TimkenSteel has been profitable 4 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months the company had a revenue of $844.7 million and loss of $0.74 a share. Its operating margin is -4.06% which ranks worse than 84% of the companies in Steel industry. Overall the profitability of TimkenSteel is ranked 3 out of 10 which indicates poor profitability. This is the revenue and net income of TimkenSteel over the past years: Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus\xe2\x80\x99 research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company\xe2\x80\x99s stock. If a company\xe2\x80\x99s business is growing the company usually creates value for its shareholders especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise if a company's revenue and earnings are declining the value of the company will decrease. TimkenSteel\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 84% of the companies in Steel industry. TimkenSteel\xe2\x80\x99s 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -29.2% which ranks worse than 89% of the companies in Steel industry.Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months TimkenSteel\xe2\x80\x99s return on invested capital is -4.31 and its cost of capital is 12.83.Overall the stock of TimkenSteel (NYSE:TMST 30-year Financials) appears to be significantly overvalued.
