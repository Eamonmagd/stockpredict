b'How Small Market Investors Are Being Wooed by Companies', b'2 hours ago', b'Executives at Koss a small Milwaukee-based headphone maker whose shares are also popular with retail investors sold significant chunks of their holdings.How Small Market Investors Are Being Wooed by Companies - The New York TimesBusiness|Hungry for Investors Some Companies Woo the Little Guyhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/stock-market-investors.htmlToday in BusinessliveLatest UpdatesSmall Investors Are on TopFighting Racist Terms in TechThe Fight Inside the Wall Street JournalAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAfter CarParts.com reported its quarterly results last month executives at the company which sells replacement auto parts did what many of their ilk do: They held a conference call with Wall Street analysts fielding questions about inventory levels profit margins and corporate strategy.Roughly 30 minutes later the same executives were on Clubhouse hosting an entirely different kind of audience. Their 2000 or so guests had gathered at the buzzy online meeting spot to learn about the company. Their questions were far more straightforward. How did the business work? Why was CarParts.com able to offer lower prices than brick-and-mortar rivals? Were CarParts.com shares worth buying?David Meniane CarParts.com\xe2\x80\x99s chief financial officer and chief operating officer called the session an experiment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to disrupt the way people fix their cars\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a way for us to disrupt how retail investors communicate with management?\xe2\x80\x9dAs the stock holdings of American households have soared to a record level over the past year dozens of companies are suddenly paying more attention to individual investors. Some like CarParts.com are trying to transform newly minted traders of Reddit-fueled viral \xe2\x80\x9cmeme stocks\xe2\x80\x9d like GameStop into dedicated shareholders. And some of those meme stock companies including GameStop itself are issuing new shares.\xe2\x80\x9cThe individual shareholder is back\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrence Cunningham a professor at George Washington University Law School who researches corporate governance and runs a research project that studies individual shareholder behavior. \xe2\x80\x9cCorporations would do well to pay attention and cultivate them.\xe2\x80\x9dSmall investors who buy single stocks have not been a major force in financial markets for the better part of half a century. In the 1960s such investors controlled over 85 percent of the stock market with most portfolios built around concentrated holdings in a few blue-chip companies.But in the 1980s and 1990s as people moved their money into mutual funds and 401(k)s large fund managers and Wall Street analysts became the constituency most important to corporate America. According to SIFMA a brokerage industry lobbying group individual investors owned just 38 percent of the stock market in direct shares in 2018.Such investors were growing in influence before the pandemic partly because of the popularity of free trading apps such as Robinhood which meshed the buying and selling of stocks with gamelike features. And companies like Tesla have long had a loud and loyal base of investors who follow the founder Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s missives on Twitter.But with millions of Americans stuck at home during the pandemic the trading trend escalated. According to the Federal Reserve American households bought roughly $211 billion in individual stocks last year \xe2\x80\x94 the highest level since 2014.\xe2\x80\x9cRetail trading now accounts for almost as much volume as mutual funds and hedge funds combined\xe2\x80\x9d Amelia Garnett an executive at Goldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99s Global Markets Division said on a recent podcast produced by the firm. \xe2\x80\x9cSo the retail impact is really meaningful right now.\xe2\x80\x9dThere\xe2\x80\x99s no telling how long Americans will keep their pandemic-bred focus on the market. Average daily trading volume at some large brokerage firms is down sharply from its peak in January and as vaccinations continue and the economy reopens newly mobile Americans may be less interested in picking stocks. But companies awakened to the power of individual investors are seizing the moment and finding new ways to engage with them.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s forced companies to understand the importance of retail investors\xe2\x80\x9d said Zach Hascoe a co-founder of Say Technologies a New York start-up that sells shareholder communication services to companies and brokerage firms. \xe2\x80\x9cCompanies are seeing the opportunity to kind of tap into shareholder loyalty tap into that passion.\xe2\x80\x9dSay Technologies offers a social-media style platform that allows companies to field questions from verified individual shareholders at key corporate events. Investors can pose their questions on Say\xe2\x80\x99s message board which can then be up-voted Reddit-style by other participants.Today in BusinessLive Updates:Updated\xc2\xa0April 13 2021 4:13 p.m. ETMore big companies speak out against voting bills as focus turns to Texas Arizona and Michigan.Tax cheats cost the U.S. $1 trillion per year I.R.S chief says.Epic Games the maker of Fortnite raises $1 billion in a funding round.Tesla which has long eschewed traditional communications with Wall Street is perhaps the best-known user of the service. Ark Investment Management \xe2\x80\x94 the high-flying tech-focused exchange-traded fund company run by the investor Cathie Wood \xe2\x80\x94 and Palantir Technologies another favorite among individual investors have also used it.ImageLemonade which sells insurance to consumers online went public in July. Individual investors make up about half of its shareholder base.Credit...Associated PressBefore Lemonade a company that sells insurance to consumers online went public in July it went on a traditional tour of Wall Street meeting big investors and talking up its prospects. However the company has since discovered that over half of its shares are held by small investors excluding insiders who own the stock said Daniel Schreiber its chief executive.That has prompted a strategy adjustment. In addition to spending time communicating with analysts whose \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d ratings on the stock can move its price Mr. Schreiber said he has made a point of doing interviews on podcasts websites and YouTube programs popular with retail investors.\xe2\x80\x9cI think that they are today far more influential on and command far more following in terms of stock buying or selling power than the mighty Goldman Sachs does\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Schreiber said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in our own stock.\xe2\x80\x9dAcademic research suggests that over the longer term it can be a competitive advantage for a company to have a patient base of investors who understand and believe in its strategy. Such a steady foundation makes it possible for executives to focus on longer-term strategic goals rather than meeting the short-term metrics often dictated by Wall Street analysts said Mr. Cunningham of George Washington University Law School.Take Amazon. Its share price kept rising over the years despite its skimpy and unpredictable profits and widespread skepticism from Wall Street. The individual shareholders who held Amazon stock bought into the vision of the founder Jeff Bezos and saw no problem with Amazon recycling its enormous cash flows back into the company rather than paying dividends. Many of those shareholders are now happy; someone who bought $1000 worth of Amazon shares at the start of 2000 would be sitting on about $40000 today.Shares of Tesla too have exploded in recent years \xe2\x80\x94 a victory for its base of cultish followers who believed in the company\xe2\x80\x99s prospects despite years of losses. Over the past five years Tesla shares have gained more than 1300 percent creating $640 billion in market wealth.While some companies are pursuing the loyalty of small shareholders others are pursuing their money. Several companies whose stocks climbed during January\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmeme stock\xe2\x80\x9d boom have taken advantage of the demand to issue new shares turning trading enthusiasm into actual cash for the company. (Previously issued shares that are bought and sold in the open market don\xe2\x80\x99t generate any new money for companies themselves.)ImageA GameStop store on Broadway in New York. The chain has said it will sell 3.5 million new shares.Credit...Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York TimesLast week GameStop announced it may sell 3.5 million new shares which would allow the company to collect at least a little of the cash that traders have been throwing at its stock. The money \xe2\x80\x94 around $500 million at current prices \xe2\x80\x94 would be used to help pay for the chain\xe2\x80\x99s efforts toward a digital business model.The hydrogen fuel cell maker Plug Power pulled off a similar maneuver in late January. A favorite of new traders who had pushed its share price up 400 percent in three months the company pocketed more than $2 billion by selling new shares. AMC Entertainment the movie theater chain popular with small traders also raised around $917 million in January including about $500 million through the sale of new shares.Some company executives are even cashing in personally. Executives at Koss a small Milwaukee-based headphone maker whose shares are also popular with retail investors sold significant chunks of their holdings. In one week in February Koss insiders sold about $44 million in stock. Michael J. Koss the chief executive and son of the founder sold shares worth more than $13 million according to a regulatory disclosure.CarParts.com the company that used Clubhouse to connect with potential shareholders will continue to pursue small investors Mr. Meniane the finance chief said. The effort is already informing how the company thinks about its product and the story it presents to investors he said.\xe2\x80\x9cI spend a lot of time talking to institutional shareholders and you know a lot of them understand the business but they spend also a lot of time building financial models\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Meniane said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas when I talk to retail investors specifically on Clubhouse it was all about the underlying business.

Whether you're listening on a newly restored cassette player boombox or portable game system or on a modern smartphone or computer the Koss x Retrospect On-Ear Headphone will have heads turning while they're on your head.To dive deeper into this collaboration we sat down with Kori Fuerst co-owner of Retropekt to talk about their history their love for vintage electronics and to learn more about the partnership and development of the all-new Koss x Retrospeckt P/21 Retro On-Ear Headphone.For those who don't know tell us a little bit about Retrospekt and what it is you do.Retrospekt refurbishes and restores vintage electronics. We are passionate about the mission of bringing well-loved well-made products back to life.We started out exclusively refurbishing Polaroid instant cameras but have since moved on to 35mm cameras portable cassette players gaming consoles and even the occasional electric instrument. Our dedicated team of 25 people works out of a facility in Milwaukee Wisconsin not too far from the Koss Headquarters.How did you guys get started in the early days?My husband and co-owner Adam Fuerst started dating in 2008 which was also the year that Polaroid announced they would no longer be manufacturing instant film. Adam was an avid shooter and he put as much money as he could save up to one last film purchase from a big box store.This supply slowly started dwindling and we had to change up our strategy to keep shooting this format we loved. The film was being sold for exorbitant amounts on eBay which was way outside our budget as college students. Instead we took to thrift stores where we could find cameras that still had some film left inside. We'd buy a camera for a few bucks and have 7 good shots left in the camera.This habit led to a somewhat large collection of cameras which we were now hauling back to Milwaukee where we both had graduate programs lined up. Our decision to start selling the cameras coincided with an effort to remake Polaroid instant film. A group of dedicated investors and fans were able to purchase the last standing film factory in The Netherlands with the long-term goal of keeping the film alive.As the film was entering the marketplace again there was suddenly a demand for cameras -- of which we had many. From that point forward we slowly started building our sales of used Polaroid cameras. We finished our graduate programs and got married but we quickly left our chosen careers to start Retrospekt.Over the years we've developed and honed our refurbishment and repair process into a really robust and thorough system that extends beyond the Polaroid instant camera. And there are a plethora of different products that we'd love to include in our refurbishment repertoire in the future. I suppose our story is the classic case of a hobby turned into a business. And while it has been challenging at times to run a small business the learning experience has been nothing short of incredible.Why do you think there has been such a renewed interest in vintage electronics like cameras cassette players & portable game systems?I think nostalgia is always an obvious driving factor but I actually think the current resurgence goes a bit deeper. In an increasingly digital and hyper-connected world I think people are appreciating the slower moments life has to offer.While certainly less efficient and convenient vintage electronics have an element of intentionality and tangibility that makes them really enjoyable to interact with.Taking a few minutes to compose a photograph flipping a record having a photograph to hold in your hand listening to an album all the way through looking through the lyric sheet of a cassette tape - all of these experiences allow us to connect with the tangible world in the moment.When you consider how Generation Z grew up consuming media almost exclusively through phone screens it makes a little more sense why interacting with analog technology becomes really alluring. We are under no illusion that people won't be ending their Spotify subscriptions to only listen to analog music but we believe people are interested in these auxiliary experiences through owning and interacting with vintage electronics. It's an honor for us to make that experience possible for anyone who wants to try.How did you get involved with Koss?When we started selling cassette players on our website we wanted to also offer quality headphones so customers could fully enjoy their new devices.We love Koss's history and our shared Milwaukee roots and we also liked how some of the Koss product line maintained a retro aesthetic that we believed our audience would enjoy.I went to the retail store to browse different headphone models and after sharing some details about Retrospekt with the service representative I was invited to the back to chat with John Koss Jr.and Michael Koss.John Koss Jr.pulled out his own Walkman from the 90s to show me and Michael Kosstold me he knew Edwin Land founder of the Polaroid Corporation who he referred to by his nickname 'Din'.The shared interests between Koss and Retrospekt were incredibly motivating and over the next few months a conversation began with myself Adam Michael Koss Jr. and the Koss design team to design a pair of exclusive retro throwback headphones with the iconic metal band and orange cushions.We all worked together to make a design that was not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and comfortable. The end result is really impressive and we are excited to finally share it with the world!Why was it important for Retrospekt to collaborate with another local Milwaukee company like Koss?We've always tried our best to keep every part of our supply chain as local as possible. The ability to meet in person with Koss to kick-off the project gave a sense of collaborative energy that can only be found in working with your literal neighbors.Our offices and workshops are mere miles apart and we all work and exist in the same city. Not only is this helpful from a mere logistics perspective but it gave the entire project a feeling of serendipity and momentum. The entire process from design to manufacturing was seamless.Obviously the new Retro On-Ear Headphones sounds incredible but what is your favorite part about the overall design and aesthetic?In a world saturated with ear-bud style headphones I was shocked by how comfortable the P/21 Retro On-Ear headphones actually were. My favorite part is the bright orange cushion; the color just exudes 1980s nostalgia. It's really eye catching and I plan to wear them on some future Zoom calls.Favorite vintage electronic ever?I've never owned one because they are incredibly rare (there is even one on display at the MOMA!) but I absolutely love the phonosuper sk 4 which is a super minimalist turntable.Designed by Dieter Rams and Hans Gugelot product designers for the German appliance company Braun the record player has a sleek wood and white design that would compete with any product on the market today. It has an acrylic cover that opens in a way that gave it the somewhat ominous nickname of 'Snow White's Coffin.'Most of my favorite vintage electronics are minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing and this one is the cr\xc3\xa8me de la cr\xc3\xa8me.What has been your most popular product at Retrospekt?The Polaroid SX-70 Camera and Sony Walkman are neck and neck with each other. Both were mass-produced by extremely popular and reputable brands and both companies have a really incredible marketing history. It's a grandiose statement but we really believe each item played a role in changing culture.For the Polaroid SX-70 launched in 1972 this was the first time people could take film photographs and see them immediately without sending the film off for processing.For the Sony Walkman launched in 1979 this was the first time people could listen to music privately on the go (it's of course worth mentioning that the invention of stereophones also was necessary for this to happen). Our customers are interested in both owning these legacy pieces for personal use but also to harbor a piece of history.Do your customers typically collect/showcase the products they purchase from Retrospekt or do you fully expect your customers to use each device as it was originally intended?The majority of customers are buying these items to use them. We offer a product warranty and really stand behind the usability of the devices. There are always collectors who purchase items for display purposes only but we sell every product as if it was going to be used by the customer.What products do you guys restore/sell that the new Retro 0n-Ear headphones will be compatible with?Our primary vision for these headphones was to pair them with the portable cassette players we restore. But a surprising amount of vintage electronics were built with a headphone jack.Nintendo Game Boys most boomboxes and even some of our turntables have the ability to output sound through headphones.

Will You Be One of Them?On April 20 at 7 p.m. ET Louis Navellier and Matt McCall will reveal an event that\xe2\x80\x99s about to rock the stock market and how you could use it to beat the markets by nearly 11X.Tue April 20 at 7:00PM ETDaysHoursMinutesSecondsRegister Here FreeHome / Trading / Trading Advice / Why a Cratered Virgin Galactic Stock May Have More Downside RiskVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) shares have crashed after a moonshot rally to start 2021. But what are the chances for a second launch? Or is there a more durable manned mission for SPCE stock investors to explore? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at market conditions off and on the price chart then offer a risk-adjusted determination aligned with that information.Source: Tun Pichitanon / Shutterstock.comTo boldly go where no man has gone before or rather no prior SPCE investors. In early January and as a beneficiary of the GameStop (NYSE:GME) short-squeeze meme trade shares of Sir Richard Branson\xe2\x80\x99s space tourism outfit rocketed higher by nearly 150% in less than three weeks to all-time-highs. Heady short interest at the time in excess of 70% of the stock\xe2\x80\x99s float certainly played a hand in the spectacular rally. Yet as with its well-shorted peers though the ride up in SPCE stock didn\xe2\x80\x99t last.From GameStop to AMC (NYSE:AMC) Blackberry (NYSE:BB) Koss Inc. (NASDAQ:KOSS) and others SPCE shares plunged nearly as fast. And in less than four trading weeks Virgin Galactic was back on the launch pad with some obvious wear and tear. So what exactly happened?The Short StoryVastly reduced short-interest fuel from burned and battered bears covering on the way up is one obvious choice for SPCE\xe2\x80\x99s steep stock correction of 62%. Today the amount of stock being sold short stands at a comparatively meager 15%. The fact is the once sky-high statistic appears to have shed over 85% on the ride up.According to MarketBeat the percentage of SPCE shares being shorted was down to 10% of the stock\xe2\x80\x99s float near its early February peak valuation. But Virgin has another threat which it can\xe2\x80\x99t simply shake off.7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10To be fair Virgin Galactic\xe2\x80\x99s stock correction of the past couple months has likely been helped by testing challenges in the New Mexico desert which persist to this day. But the other drag on SPCE shares and possibly more lethal longer-term is another starship attempting to boldly go into Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s extraterrestrial turf.Competition from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s SpaceX venture appears to have assisted with the cratering share price in SPCE. SpaceX is currently working on prototype vertical-take-off and landing or VTOL tests for its spacecraft called Starship.If successful Starship will be the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest vessel with those capabilities. That could severely impact SPCE\xe2\x80\x99s mission. There are real-world constraints of flying just a half dozen paying customers for a very pricey few minutes of weightless flight time. The thing is SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s Starship would be able to fly 100 tourists for once-in-a-lifetime extraterrestrial journeys that could theoretically last weeks.Bottom line betting against Elon has consistently proven a losing business proposition. And rather than worrying about the size of SPCE\xe2\x80\x99s bearish passengers on any given day bullish investors may be increasingly prone to permanently aborting that mission altogether.SPCE Stock Weekly Price ChartSource: Charts by TradingViewI\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first to admit it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long ago the technical visuals on SPCE stock had my interest as a name to buy as shares carved out a smaller triangle pattern. Combined with Virgin finding support off the 62% retracement level tied to its November 2019 all-time-low and challenging the stock\xe2\x80\x99s launch area out of a larger triangle prior to this year\xe2\x80\x99s massive rally SPCE was on the radar for purchasing.But an actual SPCE stock buy decision remains on hold. It may also be permanently disabled.A detailed wait-and-see approach based on a breakout above pattern resistance near $33.50 and backed by a bullish stochastics crossover hasn\xe2\x80\x99t occurred. What\xe2\x80\x99s more positioning in SPCE is now favoring a nearby bearish initiation. This is based on what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing off and on the price chart.With the secondary indicator already bearishly crossed I\xe2\x80\x99d look to gain short exposure as shares lose the 62% level as well as triangle support if SPCE sinks below last week\xe2\x80\x99s hammer-like doji candlestick. From there a bearish leaning May $26/$22/$18 put butterfly combination that\xe2\x80\x99s profitably centered near deeper zone support of $17.50 to about $21.50 looks like a good way to suit up.On the date of publication Chris Tyler does not hold directly or indirectly \xc2\xa0any positions in securities mentioned in this article.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

Over the next few weeks I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give investors research that shows when meme stocks\xe2\x80\x99 valuations get crazy and they should sell. This week I focus on GameStopGMEand put it in the\xc2\xa0Danger Zone.Why Investors Need Independent ResearchWall Street isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the business of warning investors of the dangers in risky stocks because they make too much money from their trading volume and underwriting of debt and equity sales.Only independent firms are free to provide unconflicted research and navigate\xc2\xa0Wall Street conflicts\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0analyst biases. With\xc2\xa0new technology\xc2\xa0to cut through the deluge of data in financial filings and\xc2\xa0overcome the flaws\xc2\xa0in Wall Street research self-directed investors are better positioned than ever to make informed decisions.What\xe2\x80\x99s the Problem Here?The meme stock frenzy highlights the lack of reliable fundamental research which creates a vacuum for mis-information that elevates sources like Reddit to undue levels of influence and leads investors to lose perspective.MORE FOR YOUPalantir Technologies Stock Could Fall 17%98% Of CEOs Say Biden\xe2\x80\x99s Corporate Tax Rate Hike Will Hurt Their Companies According To SurveyCoinbase Is Not Worth $100B And Its Stock Could Double On Direct ListingWithout reliable fundamental research investors have no way of gauging whether a stock is expensive or cheap. Without a reliable measure of valuation investors have little choice but to gamble if they want to own stocks. The lack of reliable fundamental research is a big problem if we want the market to have integrity and not unfairly advantage those with better information.Figure 1: Mis-Information for Self-Directed Investors Is At an All-Time HighWall Street Bets MisInformationEveripediaMeme Stock #1: GameStop: Danger Zone Anywhere Above $45/shareGME was not worth owning anywhere above $45/share given the company\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentals as explained when I closed my\xc2\xa0Focus List: Long position\xc2\xa0in the stock\xc2\xa0in late January. Nevertheless the stock went on to climb as high as $347/share before taking a roller coaster path back to ~$185/share. See Figure 2.Figure 2: Fundamental Research to Know When to Sell GMEGME Fundamental Radar Danger Above 45New Constructs LLCTo give readers a sense of just how crazy overvalued the stock was at its peak I do the math and show how the business would have to perform to justify $347/share.\xe2\x80\x9cCrazy\xe2\x80\x9d at $347 Explained: Implies More Revenue Than Macy\xe2\x80\x99sMMy\xc2\xa0reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model\xc2\xa0is an excellent research tool to analyze the expectations implied by stock prices. To justify $347/share it shows that GameStop must:improve its\xc2\xa0profit margin\xc2\xa0to 5.5% (10-yr avg from 2010-19 is 3.9% & all-time high was 4.8% in 2008) andgrow revenue by 17% compounded annually through 2030 (above\xc2\xa0projected\xc2\xa0video game industry CAGR of 13% through 2027)In this\xc2\xa0scenario GameStop earns nearly $21 billion in revenue in 2030 or more than the trailing-twelve-months (TTM) revenue of Macy\xe2\x80\x99s (M)\xc2\xa0AutoZoneAZO and ChewyCHWY. See Figure 3 for details.Figure 3: GameStop\xe2\x80\x99s Historical Revenue vs. DCF Implied Revenue: Scenario 1GME DCF Scenario 1 Justify 347New Constructs LLCFor reference GameStop\xe2\x80\x99s revenue fell by 3% compounded annually from 2009 to 2019.Still Crazy: At $185For perspective on the current price I run the same analysis to show what the company must do to justify $185/share:immediately improve its profit margin to 4.8% (all-time high in 2008 compared to 0.7% in 2019) andgrow revenue by 15% compounded annually through 2027 (above projected video game industry CAGR of 13% through 2027)In this\xc2\xa0scenario GameStop earns over $11 billion in revenue in 2027 which is 19% higher than GameStop\xe2\x80\x99s record revenue of $9.6 billion in 2012 and the TTM revenue of NordstromJWN Advance Auto PartsAAP and Chewy.

Each of these stocks were on Robinhood\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0restricted stocks list\xc2\xa0and each saw a major rise and fall in late January.I will also feature other meme stocks that trade at levels entirely disconnected from fundamental reality such as NetflixNFLXand TeslaTSLA.Figure 5: Meme Stocks Disconnected From Fundamental RealityMeme Stocks Disconnected From FundamentalsNew Constructs LLCDisclosure: David Trainer Kyle Guske II and Matt Shuler receive no compensation to write about any specific stock style or theme.[1]\xc2\xa0Only Core Earnings enable investors to overcome the inaccuracies omissions and biases in legacy fundamental data and research as proven in\xc2\xa0Core Earnings: New Data & Evidence a forthcoming paper in\xc2\xa0The Journal of Financial Economics\xc2\xa0written by professors at Harvard Business School (HBS) & MIT Sloan.Follow me on\xc2\xa0Twitter.\xc2\xa0Check out\xc2\xa0my\xc2\xa0website.\xc2\xa0David TrainerNew Constructs leverages reliable fundamental data to provide unconflicted insights into the fundamentals and valuation of private and public businesses.
