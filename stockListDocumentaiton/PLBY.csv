(NASDAQ:PLBY) can tell us which group is most powerful. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes "a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people." So it\'s nice to see some insider ownership because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.With a market capitalization of US$1.5b PLBY Group is a decent size so it is probably on the radar of institutional investors. In the chart below we can see that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let\'s delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about PLBY Group. Check out our latest analysis for PLBY Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PLBY Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it\'s included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.PLBY Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It\'s therefore worth looking at PLBY Group\'s earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don\'t have many shares in PLBY Group. The company\'s largest shareholder is Suhail Rizvi with ownership of 44%. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 6.9% and 2.4% of the shares outstanding respectively.After doing some more digging we found that the top 2 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company\'s shares implying that they have considerable power to influence the company\'s decisions.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock\'s expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PLBY GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of PLBY Group Inc.. Insiders own US$699m worth of shares in the US$1.5b company. That\'s quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders especially in a company of this size. You canclick here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership the general public have some degree of sway over PLBY Group. While this group can\'t necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Equity OwnershipWith a stake of 8.2% private equity firms could influence the PLBY Group board. Some investors might be encouraged by this since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

The stocks that are heavily bought by hedge funds historically outperformed the market though there is no shortage of high profile failures like hedge funds\' 2018 losses in Facebook and Apple. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at what the funds we track think about Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) in this article.Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) shares haven\'t seen a lot of action during the second quarter. Overall hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was in 33 hedge funds\' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Our calculations also showed that REV isn\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings). At the end of this article we will also compare REV to other stocks including PLBY Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PLBY) Flushing Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:FFIC) and Heritage-Crystal Clean Inc. (NASDAQ:HCCI) to get a better sense of its popularity.In the eyes of most investors hedge funds are perceived as slow outdated financial tools of years past. While there are more than 8000 funds with their doors open at the moment Our experts choose to focus on the cr\xc3\xa8me de la cr\xc3\xa8me of this club around 850 funds. These investment experts command bulk of the smart money\'s total asset base and by shadowing their unrivaled stock picks Insider Monkey has unsheathed various investment strategies that have historically surpassed the S&P 500 index. Insider Monkey\'s flagship short hedge fund strategy exceeded the S&P 500 short ETFs by around 20 percentage points a year since its inception in March 2017. Also our monthly newsletter\'s portfolio of long stock picks returned 206.8% since March 2017 (through May 2021) and beat the S&P 500 Index by more than 115 percentage points.

We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind let\'s review the fresh hedge fund action encompassing Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV).Do Hedge Funds Think REV Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?At the end of the first quarter a total of 33 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock a change of 0% from the previous quarter. Below you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards REV over the last 23 quarters. With the smart money\'s positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow there exists a select group of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes considerably (or already accumulated large positions).More specifically Pzena Investment Management was the largest shareholder of Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) with a stake worth $82.2 million reported as of the end of March. Trailing Pzena Investment Management was SQN Investors which amassed a stake valued at $42.3 million. Praesidium Investment Management Company Sectoral Asset Management and Pura Vida Investments were also very fond of the stock becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position SCW Capital Management allocated the biggest weight to Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) around 11.3% of its 13F portfolio. P.A.W. CAPITAL PARTNERS is also relatively very bullish on the stock designating 2.39 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to REV.Since Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) has faced falling interest from hedge fund managers it\'s easy to see that there lies a certain "tier" of hedgies that slashed their entire stakes by the end of the first quarter. Interestingly Will Cook\'s Sunriver Management dropped the biggest position of the "upper crust" of funds followed by Insider Monkey valued at close to $14.2 million in stock and Jamie Zimmerman\'s Litespeed Management was right behind this move as the fund cut about $11.5 million worth. These transactions are important to note as total hedge fund interest stayed the same (this is a bearish signal in our experience).Let\'s now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV). We will take a look at PLBY Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PLBY) Flushing Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:FFIC) Heritage-Crystal Clean Inc. (NASDAQ:HCCI) Dorian LPG Ltd (NYSE:LPG) Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:TARS) Chinook Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:KDNY) and Beazer Homes USA Inc. (NYSE:BZH).

That figure was $358 million in REV\'s case. Dorian LPG Ltd (NYSE:LPG) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Tarsus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:TARS) is the least popular one with only 8 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Revlon Inc (NYSE:REV) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for REV is 81.1. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 22.8% in 2021 through July 2nd and still beat the market by 6 percentage points. Unfortunately REV wasn\'t nearly as popular as these 5 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on REV were disappointed as the stock returned 1.1% since the end of the first quarter (through 7/2) and underperformed the market.

b'Calculating The Fair Value Of PLBY Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PLBY)', b'4 days ago', b'In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of PLBY Group Inc. ... Simply Wall St updates its DCF calculation for every American stock every day...Calculating The Fair Value Of PLBY Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PLBY) - Simply Wall St News In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of PLBY Group Inc. (NASDAQ:PLBY) by estimating the company\'s future cash flows and discounting them to their present value.Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.It may sound complicated but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company\'s value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws.If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.Check out our latest analysis for PLBY GroupCrunching the numbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth and the second stage is a lower growth phase.In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years.Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the futureand so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\'s value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031Levered FCF ($ Millions)US$30.8m US$43.5m US$53.3m US$62.1m US$69.6m US$76.0m US$81.3m US$85.7m US$89.5m US$92.8m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Est @ 22.68% Est @ 16.47% Est @ 12.13% Est @ 9.09% Est @ 6.96% Est @ 5.47% Est @ 4.42% Est @ 3.69%Present Value ($ Millions) Discounted @ 7.1%US$28.7 US$37.9 US$43.5 US$47.3 US$49.5 US$50.4 US$50.4 US$49.6 US$48.4 US$46.9 ("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$452m We now need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today\'s value at a cost of equity of 7.1%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 \xc3\x97 (1 + g) \xc3\xb7 (r \xe2\x80\x93 g) = US$93m\xc3\x97 (1 + 2.0%) \xc3\xb7 (7.1%\xe2\x80\x93 2.0%) = US$1.9bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9b\xc3\xb7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$943m The total value or equity value is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flowswhich in this case is US$1.4b.In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.Compared to the current share price of US$37.7 the company appearsaround fair valueat the time of writing.Remember though that this is just an approximate valuation and like any complex formula - garbage in garbage out. NasdaqGM:PLBY Discounted Cash Flow July 2nd 2021Important assumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows.You don\'t have to agree with these inputs I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them.The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company\'s future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company\'s potential performance.Given that we are looking at PLBY Group as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt.In this calculation we\'ve used 7.1% which is based on a levered beta of 1.075. Beta is a measure of a stock\'s volatility compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important itshouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool.Rather it should be seen as a guide to "what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"If a company grows at a different rate or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply the output can look very different.For PLBY Group we\'ve compiled threefurtheritemsyou should further research:Risks: For example we\'ve discovered 1 warning sign for PLBY Group that you should be aware of before investing here.Future Earnings: How does PLBY\'s growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?
