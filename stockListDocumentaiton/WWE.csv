Here at Cageside we do a stock report.In this weekly series we identify three Superstars (or groups of Superstars) who are on their way up and three that are moving in the opposite direction. After a busy week that included the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal Tamina going one-on-one with Nia Jax and Baron Corbin wrestling in the main event of Raw a lot of fortunes were changed.With that in mind let\xe2\x80\x99s see whose stock has increased the most this week:Stock Up #3: Rhea RipleyRhea Ripley turned on Asuka during a tag team match on this week\xe2\x80\x99s (Apr. 5) Raw making things more personal between the two superstars and cementing Rhea\xe2\x80\x99s spot as the heel in their upcoming match at WrestleMania 37.Stock Up #2: Dolph Ziggler & Robert RoodeI was genuinely surprised to see the Top Dirty Dawgs win this week\xe2\x80\x99s (Apr. 9) fatal 4-way match for the SmackDown tag titles over the Street Profits the Mysterios and Alpha Academy. Roode & Ziggler have essentially wiped out the competition for their tag titles multiple times over the last three months.Stock Up #1: Bad Bunny Damian Priest The Miz John MorrisonThe story between these four men received a huge focus on Raw; things escalated quite a bit from the previous weeks of trading guitar shots.It started when Miz & Morrison gave Bunny\xe2\x80\x99s multi-million dollar car a custom paint job and then ambushed him afterwards. This led toa very long but mostly effective promo from Bunny asserting that the Miz is going to get his ass kicked at WrestleMania. To cap it off Priest and Morrison were officially added to the match. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing because they are both much better workers than their respective tag partners.Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss WrestleMania 37 on Peacock!WWE Network has moved and Peacock will be your source for every live WWE pay-per-view event\xe2\x80\x94including WrestleMania.Sign up here!Now let\xe2\x80\x99s see whose stock has decreased the most this week:Stock Down #3: Elias & Jaxson RykerWWE wants us to believe that 51 year old Shane McMahon is a better professional wrestler than both Elias and Jaxson Ryker.Elias & Ryker continually get fed to Braun Strowman (this week in a handicap match) while Shane is the athlete who Braun struggles to take down. These two guys come off as total jabronis while playing the role of Shane\xe2\x80\x99s hapless lackeys.Stock Down #2: Nikki Cross Peyton Royce RECKONINGThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of consternation over Bayley\xe2\x80\x99s glaring absence from WrestleMania 37. But these three women are also missing from the card and it\xe2\x80\x99s worth talking about.WWE tried to get most of the women\xe2\x80\x99s division on the WrestleMania card by booking a Tag Team Turmoil match. Five teams will compete in that match including the completely made-up team of Billie Kay and Carmella. I understand if RECKONING can\xe2\x80\x99t be paired with anybody due to her terrible RETRIBUTION gimmick but what about Peyton Royce and Nikki Cross? Surely there\xe2\x80\x99s room for one additional makeshift team in the turmoil match no?According to CageMatch Mia Yim has not wrestled a match in 2021. Royce was left out in the cold despite her obvious history with Billie Kay reinforcing that the breakup of The IIconics was a pointless decision. And Nikki Cross is lamenting on Twitter about how she just wants to wrestle and it\xe2\x80\x99s what she was born to do. Unfortunately it looks like she won\xe2\x80\x99t get to do it at WrestleMania 37.Stock Down #1: Cedric Alexander & Shelton BenjaminI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who these guys pissed off but they continue to get beaten into the ground. Lashley beat the hell out of both of them on Raw and then they were bounced very early on during the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on SmackDown. This is the fourth consecutive week that Benjamin and Alexander have appeared on the Stock Down side of this column and the third straight week where they\xe2\x80\x99ve landed in the very worst spot.There you have it Cagesiders.

Instead of operating as a streaming service it now wants to return to making content.WWE will host the Super Bowl of wrestling this weekend with its WrestleMania event on NBCUniversal\'s Peacock streaming service. It\'s part of a more than $1 billion exclusive rights deal that is repositioning the longtime entertainment company to focus on its product and avoid the streaming wars."At the end of the day we\'re not a technology company and shouldn\'t try to be" WWE chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon told CNBC. "We are a content company at our core and we want to do what we do best."Added chief financial officer Kristina Salen: "Everyone has a plus. There is Disney+ Paramount+ Discovery+ but not everyone has branded content with a huge fan base like WWE. So we saw there was a huge demand for what we had to offer and we could take that money and double down and do what we do best which is content."The focus on creating content shows a sort of counter-narrative to the streaming wars where companies create apps and services loaded with movies and TV shows. WWE is ditching its own streaming service and is instead focusing on making new stuff for people to watch on Peacock.The content game is only the beginning for WWE in this new decade as it prepares for a post-Covid world with new revenue possibilities. But the future will also bring questions about whether WWE is a smart investment and how it plans to approach more competition that wants to threaten its market share.WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon of US speaks during the Web Summit 2018 in Lisbon Portugal on November 6 2018.Pedro Fi\xc3\xbaza | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesLessons learnedLike the rest of the entertainment world WWE had to innovate on the fly after the pandemic hit last spring. The company moved events to Florida to continue operations and save media rights. It adjusted to no spectators by transitioning its pyrotechnics-filled content to a more cinematic production around wrestling matches."It\'s like a movie" McMahon said after describing longtime character The Undertaker\'s cemetery-style match last year. "And in addition to that the real innovation came with investing in the Thunderdome" \xe2\x80\x93 an indoor complex built in Florida to host events."We experimented with drone cameras pyros augmented reality that we couldn\'t have done before mostly because of live bodies in the actual stands" McMahon added. "It\'s going to be a lot of testing and learning what makes sense to bring forward and trying different things."WWE\'s real transition started before Covid-19 when chairman and CEO Vince McMahon fired two critical executives in January 2020. Talk around this change centered on seeing the future differently.In 2014 former WWE co-president George Barrios saw value in the company\'s new streaming service. It cost $10 a month and helped the company transition away from traditional pay per view. But WWE failed to grow subscribers reaching about 1 million in the U.S. In addition the company exited another failed pro football start-up with the XFL.WWE Network dismantled its U.S. operations to start 2021 and signed with Peacock. The move provides live WWE events and a classic wrestling library to Peacock subscribers."It\'s a big win for WWE" said media rights expert Dan Cohen. "The price point comes down so you hope that subscribers and eyeballs go up. They got out of the technology space and don\'t have to keep maintaining and updating tech which changes every minute."Salen Etsy\'s former CFO was one of two new executives hired in 2020. She helped Etsy go public in 2015 and is now partly responsible for WWE\'s financial future including more merchandising e-commerce and corporate sponsorships which will feature new campaigns with longtime partner Procter & Gamble.In its 2020 fourth-quarter report WWE said it suffered an $84 million hit and made $238.2 million in revenue. But though WWE hosted most events with no fans in attendance last year it still made $970 million thanks to Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal\'s rights fees.WWE currently has a market capitalization of roughly $4 billion and is trading at approximately $55 per share. Salen said the WWE Network didn\'t lose money but again its C-Suite consensus was focused on growing licensing fees around its content and to stop operating like Netflix."Just like we were first in pay per view first in direct to consumer and now we\'re the first to go back into aggregators" Salen said. "We felt it was the right moment. And over the course of the next few years we\'re pretty confident that we\'ll be proven right."Salen said an inquiry she\'s often getting from Wall Street: Why should investors be interested in WWE stock?"Investors know that I choose to spend my time at places where ultimately think there is value to be created" she responded. "I think there is this tremendous opportunity over the next few years to create more value for shareholders."WrestleMania 35Source: WWENo concern for the competition\xc2\xa0WrestleMania 37 is scheduled this weekend at Raymond James Stadium the site of the National Football League\'s Super Bowl LV in February.`It\'s banking on 25000 fans showing up and McMahon said the event will mimic many of the NFL\'s Covid-19 protocols \xe2\x80\x93 seating pods distribution of masks hand sanitizer. "Only the configuration is different because we can have people down on the floor" she added.WWE needs to get back to arenas though and maybe more so than pro leagues. The company makes a significant portion of its revenue around live ticket sales and it travels more often throughout the year."As soon as arenas are open for business we can start spinning this up" Salen said. "But we need there to be a critical mass of arenas that are open for business in order for us to do that. And we just don\'t see that right now."WWE also needs to monitor another company that wants to eat into its market share. WarnerMedia\'s Turner Sports property has reinvested in wrestling with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The network last hosted a major wrestling company in 2001 when it owned World Championship Wrestling (WCW) which WWE purchased.AEW is run by Tony Khan son of National Football League team owner Shahid Khan and has financial backing. And so far it\'s gaining praise for its production."The theatrics are good" said Cohen. "The quality is good. Where AEW lacks though is in star power."Internet chatter suggests the WWE will spend money to keep AEW from achieving that mission. Asked about this Salen said the rumors are not accurate. She added AEW is more competition for its NXT property. This division is like the NBA\'s G League for wrestlers."We\'ve always had competition it\'s part of the game" Salen said. "Internally we pay much closer attention to a Game 7 of the World Series and if Raw is going up against it."World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. Chairman Vince McMahon (L) and wrestler Triple H appear in the ring during the WWE Monday Night Raw show at the Thomas & Mack Center August 24 2009Ethan Miller | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesWhat\'s the future of WWE?But though WWE could once again hold off a significant challenger it can\'t stop the future. And among the major questions facing it: How long will Vince McMahon continue as CEO? And who will replace him?His daughter Stephanie suggested it would be a collaboration of "institutional knowledge" making the decisions when her father decides to step aside."No one person has all that experience and expertise and passion in building and growing this company from a smaller regional business to this incredible growth company that it is today" she said.Asked to describe WWE\'s future over the long term McMahon used the company tagline. "It sums up everything about WWE" she said. "That is: then now and forever."Disclosure: Peacock is the streaming service of NBCUniversal parent company of CNBC.VIDEO2:5602:56Major brands distance themselves from Deshaun Watson after sexual misconduct allegationsThe News with Shepard SmithSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoCoinDeskBitcoin Analysts Set Sights on $70K (Even $80K) After All-Time HighBitcoin is seen rising towards $70K by May according to several analysts interviewed by CoinDesk.17h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2NeckRelaxWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdSkip The Chiropractor & Reduce Neck& Shoulder PainThanks to its compact and ingenious design I can use the NeckRelax practically anywhere.

From stocks to bonds to traditional foreign-exchange venues trading volumes are razor thin after the government slapped on rigid currency restrictions in the lead up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s debt default.Except that is in one unusual corner of markets. There brokerages are doing a bustling business -- and raking in record profits -- by handling the types of arcane transactions that Argentines use to convert pesos into dollars and circumvent the limits the government placed on obtaining foreign currencies. At least five firms reported income surges of 500% or more last year with one of them a large shop called Allaria Ledesma posting a 2200% increase.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going through a boom\xe2\x80\x9d said Julio Merlini the chief executive officer of Balanz Capital which has doubled its client base and boosted its workforce by more than half since the controls were imposed in 2019. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople stopped investing in mutual funds and timed deposits and are dollarizing portfolios.\xe2\x80\x9dBut as Argentines eschew traditional investments to focus on converting their assets to dollars before the peso weakens even further banks are forbidden from operating in the so-called blue-chip swap markets used to get foreign currency. That helped lead the sector to its worst performance in 13 years. A steady stream of bankers have left to join brokerages since the restrictions were put in place in 2019 with Merlini estimating they can earn about 50% more in their new jobs.It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the fallout from former President Mauricio Macri\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose capital controls amid a rush for the doors after the political opposition won a key primary in 2019. The move left foreign investors with no easy way to get their money out of the country and crimped the ability of Argentines to buy dollars leaving them to either watch the value of their peso savings tumble amid rampant inflation or seek an escape in the blue-chip swap.Called the contado con liquidacion in Spanish the swap has been around for almost two decades in Argentina with use peaking when restrictions are dialed up and the peso\xe2\x80\x99s prospects deteriorate. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually undertaken by buying peso assets locally and then selling them abroad for dollars creating an exchange rate that\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 38% weaker than the official one.It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of parallel rates that have taken hold in Argentina amid the economic turmoil of the past few years. The country has been rocked by a 60% drop for the peso since the end of 2018 a $60 billion default by the federal government and the worst economic collapse since 2002 last year amid one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s strictest pandemic lockdowns.As the blue-chip swap took off more typical financial transactions have seen reduced volumes. Financial entities traded a daily average of $167 million in the spot foreign-exchange market last year down 67% from a year earlier. Fixed-income volume in the Mercado Abierto Electronico which is owned by banks fell by more than half to $96 billion.At the Argentine Stock Exchange mostly the domain of brokers fixed-income volumes jumped 57% in 2020 to $247 billion.The shifts have propelled a surge in bank departures as investment professionals seek out higher wages and less regulatory scrutiny. At least a dozen prominent bankers have made the switch since mid-2019 including HSBC Plc trader Juan Manuel Truppia\xe2\x80\x99s jump to TPCG Valores. Other high-profile moves include Manuel Rocha-Nan\xe2\x80\x99s switch from head of corporate sales at Banco Galicia to Max Capital and Carolina Gialdi a fixed-income strategist at BTG Pactual who also joined Max Capital.\xe2\x80\x9cThe brokers today are fed by the banks\xe2\x80\x9d said Juan Rodriguez Braun a partner at Max Capital which increased its workforce by 25% in 2020 to 50 employees.

BloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider.

However that\xe2\x80\x99s the case with the semiconductor industry. Chip manufacturers are facing supply chain disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Semiconductors are in high demand for the big tech companies who need the chips to power the servers for their data centers. But they are also needed for much of the technology we take for granted including laptops tablets mobile phones gaming consoles and automobiles \xe2\x80\x93 a sector that seems to be at the root of the current crisis.Any weekend mechanic knows that even traditional internal combustion cars are heavily reliant on electronics. In fact electronic parts and components account for 40% of a new internal combustion vehicle. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than doubled since 2000.However as it turns out some manufacturers may have overestimated how soon consumers would be ready for an \xe2\x80\x9call-electric\xe2\x80\x9d future. And that meant that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t forecast how much demand there would be for the kind of chips needed to do the mundane but vital tasks of steering braking and even powering windows up and down.Part of the problem is that U.S. businesses are heavily reliant on countries like China and Taiwan for their semiconductors. In fact only about 12.5% of semiconductor manufacturing is done in the United States.Of course this creates a tremendous opportunity for the companies that manufacture these chips. And it comes at a good time. The semiconductor sector is notoriously cyclical and was coming down from the elevated demand for the 5G buildout.In this special presentation we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a list of seven semiconductor companies that you can invest in to take advantage of this opportunity.View the "7 Semiconductor Stocks Set to Gain From the Chip Shortage".Free Email NewsletterComplete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:Email AddressMost Read This Week3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows Ready to Buy3 Growth Stocks Displaying Market Leadership3 Stocks with Bullish Insider ActivityViacom Stock is a Bargain Pullback Opportunity Here3 Capital Markets Stocks to Buy Now3 Sectors To Buy When The Market Pulls Back\xc2\xa0Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) IPO: 3 Things for Investors to KnowArtificial Intelligence Revolution: 3 Stocks to Automate Your GainsSemiconductor Industry Set To Benefit From Global Chip ShortageSleeping Giant Cisco Stock is Reawakening For a Huge Breakout Recent ArticlesInsteel Industries Stock is a U.S. Infrastructure Pure PlayNXP Semiconductors Looks to Carry Momentum into 20213 Dividend Stocks to Help You Fight Inflation3 Online Payment Stocks Capitalizing On Covid-Era Trends3 Consumer Defensive Stocks Delivering Tech-Like ReturnsDiscovery Networks Stock is a Becoming a Pullback Opportunity Lower3 High Margin Companies Worth BuyingThe Lovesac Hyper-Growth Story Hits New High\xc2\xa0Bed Bath & Beyond Looks Beyond its Meme Stock DaysJPMorgan Flat After Blow-Out QuarterSearch Headlines:Search ArticlesMarketBeat Minute PodcastEach market day you\'ll get a one-minute market summary to help you invest wisely.Subscribe to MarketBeat Minute30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for $1.00Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat\'s full suite of research tools:Best-in-Class Portfolio MonitoringView the latest news buy/sell ratings SEC filings and insider transactions for your stocks.
