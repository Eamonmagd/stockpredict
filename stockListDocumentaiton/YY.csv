In our view the stock is undervalued as it fails to reflect rising share prices at subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x94all subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x99 earnings and valuations are improving. HHI Holdings\xe2\x80\x99 stock split and high dividend yield also warrant attention.Raise TP to W80000 to reflect stock split and 15.2% NAV increaseWe revise our TP from W370000 to W80000 to reflect: 1) a stock split (1:5) that took place on Apr 12; and 2) a 15.2% increase in NAV since we published our last report four months ago. Of note on a post-stock split basis our previous TP came to W74000.Corporate value improving for subsidiaries; share price still lowValuations have improved for all subsidiaries thanks to the recovery of the industrial economy following the easing of Covid-19 and the favorable stock market environment. The share prices of Kospi-listed subsidiaries (KSOE Hyundai CE and Hyundai Electric) have risen 26.7% over the past four months. Furthermore peers of the core unlisted subsidiary Hyundai Oilbank have enjoyed an increase in valuations (average P/B upping from 1.27x to 1.50x).We expect earnings to improve at all subsidiaries as they operate in key industries such as shipbuilding machinery and refinery. Overall sales growth of more than 25% y-y is expected this year with profitability at the shipbuilding arm likely to improve on the back of expanding vessel prices.Stock trading resumes Apr 13; focus on liquidity improvement and dividend capacityStock trading is to resume on Apr 13 at a share price of W56600. We expect to see stronger share performance thanks to the stock split. Also despite being an industrial player the firm\xe2\x80\x99s high dividend yield of 6.54% warrants attention.Source: Business Korea2021-04-14hellenicshippingnews...tweetSharePrevious: Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s DP World seeks $210.2 million in damages from DjiboutiNext: UK Club issues crew health advice on griefRelated NewsABS Joins SOFC4Maritime Fuel Cell Development JDP14/04/2021W\xc3\xa4rtsil\xc3\xa4\xe2\x80\x99s next-level predictive maintenance service can lead to fleet-wide implementation by Japanese shipping group14/04/2021Optimarin surfs retrofit wave with orders for over 100 units so far in 202114/04/2021SponsorsWeekly Dry Time Charter EstimatesRead MoreWeekly Tanker Time Charter EstimatesRead MoreWEEKLY CONTAINER INDEXRead MoreFOLLOW USLIVE SHIPS TRAFFIC MAPRead MoreSTOCK NEWSRead MoreSponsorsNewsletterSubscribe to our email newsletter.NameEmailSubscribing I accept the privacy rules of this siteRecent VideosBuoy-men swim again05/04/2021Impressive: The New Railway Bridge Kattwyk01/04/2021Shipping Finance 2021 | Episode328/03/2021Shipping Finance 2021 | Episode228/03/2021Shipping Finance 2021 | Episode128/03/2021Williams Shipping Flexible Storage Solution25/03/2021CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN Next-generation Environmentally Friendly Car Carrier Fueled by LNG12/03/2021TECO 2030 to set up giga factory for production of hydrogen-based fuel cells in Narvik Norway10/03/2021Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide Online Daily Newspaper on Hellenic and International ShippingShipping NewsTop StoriesHellenic Shipping NewsInternational Shipping NewsDry Bulk MarketPiracy and Security NewsShipping: Emission PossibleMarine Insurance P&I Club NewsPort NewsShipbuilding NewsShipping Law NewsInterviewsRecent VideosLive Piracy MapLive Ships Worldwide Traffic MapReal Time Marine WeatherDNV GL Maritime Academy HellasEvents and Training CoursesSea Tourism and YachtingUseful LinksRss FeedsSite MapMobile Applications and Social MediaCommoditiesCommodity NewsChinese iron ore and steelmaking pricesFreight NewsGuide for Carriage of Hazardous MaterialsShip Risk Profile CalculatorWorld EconomyWorld Economy NewsIMF/OECD NewsOil & EnergyOil & Companies NewsGeneral Energy NewsBunker Prices WorldwideReport / AnalysisWeekly Dry Time Charter EstimatesWeekly Tanker Time Charter EstimatesWeekly Container Reports IndexWeekly Vessel Valuations ReportDaily Tanker Market RatesDaily Bunker ReportCheapest Bunker Port MatrixWeekly Shipbrokers ReportsMonthly Shipbrokers ReportsWeekly Demolition ReportsWeekly Ship SalesWeekly Shipbuilding ReportsMarine Engine SpecificationsShipping GlossaryConnect with UsContact us - Send your newsCookie PolicyPrivacy PolicySubscribe to our free daily newsletterStock Market NewsStock NewsStock Market SnapshotDaily Currencies RatingsHellenic Shipping CompaniesLive Hellenic Shipping StocksLive International Shipping StocksLive Commodity Trade MarketsFollow us\xc2\xa9 2021 Copyright Hellenic Shipping News WorldwideAll Rights Reserved.Disclaimer-Web Design & DevelopmentPG-SoftwareThis site uses cookies to enhance your user experience.

Per the data compiled by the independent research firm a total 69.9 million PCs were shipped during the quarter up 32% from the year-ago period.Mikako Kitagawa research director at Gartner said \xe2\x80\x9cThis growth should be viewed in the context of two unique factors: comparisons against a pandemic-constrained market and the current global semiconductor shortage.\xe2\x80\x9d She further added \xe2\x80\x9cWithout the shipment chaos in early 2020 this quarter\xe2\x80\x99s growth may have been lower. However semiconductor shortages are now adversely affecting the supply chain once again with shipment lead times for some PCs extending to as long as four months.\xe2\x80\x9dKitagawa stated that the shortage of chip supply might lead to lower PC shipments. However she believes demand to be strong despite the relaxations of the stay-at-home restrictions.Gartner does not include Chromebook sales in its PC shipment results. The research firm noted that Chromebook shipments increased in triple digits during the March-end quarter mainly driven by solid investments by educational institutions in North America. Including Chromebook sales worldwide shipments jumped 47% year over year.PC Sales Likely to GrowThe pandemic has necessitated the use of PC systems be it for remote work web-based learning video conferencing video gaming social media consumer entertainment and streaming or online shopping.Moreover as vaccine distribution and democratization take time the risk of contracting the new COVID-19 mutant strain is expected to keep people confined to the safety of their homes for quite some time now. This in turn will boost the prospects of the PC market in the days ahead.On the heels of stellar consumer demand and supply shortages-led carry-forward of backlog into the remaining quarters of 2021 the momentum in PC market is poised to sustain.Top VendorsPer the data compiled by Gartner all top PC manufacturers witnessed year-over-year increases in shipments in the first quarter. During the January-March quarter Lenovo (LNVGY Quick QuoteLNVGY-Free Report)expanded its stake over HP (HPQ Quick QuoteHPQ-Free Report) maintaining the top vendor position with a market share of 25.1%.One Year Price PerformanceLenovo recorded the highest growth of 42.3% among the top six vendors chiefly on increased shipments of desk-based PCs in China. Gartner noted that the company was more in control of their supply chain as Lenovo manufactures the majority percentage of PCs in-house compared with other vendors.HP continued to be in the second position with a market share of 21.4%. HP shipped 34.6% higher PCs sequentially during the quarter primarily mainly aided by a 60% jump in Latin America. This upswing is chiefly attributable to soft year-over-year comparisons as the company\xe2\x80\x99s shipments were hit hard by the pandemic-induced supply-chain disruptions.Dell Technologies (DELL Quick QuoteDELL-Free Report)holds the third position with a market share of 16.5%. The company recorded year-over-year shipment growth of 12.9% the slowest among the top six vendors. This sluggish growth rate reflects the company\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of focusing more on business or enterprise PC and pull away from consumer products.Apple (AAPL Quick QuoteAAPL-Free Report) Acer Group and ASUS hold the next three positions with a respective market share of 8% 5.7% and 5.4%.The research firm Gartner and PC vendors Lenovo HP Dell and Apple carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold) at present.

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients.

BenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Coin RivetBitcoin rally fueled by institutional investment says Bitfinex CTOBitcoin has impressively surged to a new record high of $63500 this morning following a two-month period of consolidation beneath the $60000 level of resistance.1d agoBloombergTikTok Founder\'s $60 Billion Fortune Places Him Among The World\'s Richest People(Bloomberg) -- Just last year the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable startup ByteDance Ltd. was being squeezed from all sides.The Trump administration wanted the Chinese firm which owns the ubiquitous TikTok video-sharing platform to get rid of assets. Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce.

From stocks to bonds to traditional foreign-exchange venues trading volumes are razor thin after the government slapped on rigid currency restrictions in the lead up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s debt default.Except that is in one unusual corner of markets. There brokerages are doing a bustling business -- and raking in record profits -- by handling the types of arcane transactions that Argentines use to convert pesos into dollars and circumvent the limits the government placed on obtaining foreign currencies. At least five firms reported income surges of 500% or more last year with one of them a large shop called Allaria Ledesma posting a 2200% increase.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going through a boom\xe2\x80\x9d said Julio Merlini the chief executive officer of Balanz Capital which has doubled its client base and boosted its workforce by more than half since the controls were imposed in 2019. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople stopped investing in mutual funds and timed deposits and are dollarizing portfolios.\xe2\x80\x9dBut as Argentines eschew traditional investments to focus on converting their assets to dollars before the peso weakens even further banks are forbidden from operating in the so-called blue-chip swap markets used to get foreign currency. That helped lead the sector to its worst performance in 13 years. A steady stream of bankers have left to join brokerages since the restrictions were put in place in 2019 with Merlini estimating they can earn about 50% more in their new jobs.It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the fallout from former President Mauricio Macri\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose capital controls amid a rush for the doors after the political opposition won a key primary in 2019. The move left foreign investors with no easy way to get their money out of the country and crimped the ability of Argentines to buy dollars leaving them to either watch the value of their peso savings tumble amid rampant inflation or seek an escape in the blue-chip swap.Called the contado con liquidacion in Spanish the swap has been around for almost two decades in Argentina with use peaking when restrictions are dialed up and the peso\xe2\x80\x99s prospects deteriorate. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually undertaken by buying peso assets locally and then selling them abroad for dollars creating an exchange rate that\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 38% weaker than the official one.It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of parallel rates that have taken hold in Argentina amid the economic turmoil of the past few years. The country has been rocked by a 60% drop for the peso since the end of 2018 a $60 billion default by the federal government and the worst economic collapse since 2002 last year amid one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s strictest pandemic lockdowns.As the blue-chip swap took off more typical financial transactions have seen reduced volumes. Financial entities traded a daily average of $167 million in the spot foreign-exchange market last year down 67% from a year earlier. Fixed-income volume in the Mercado Abierto Electronico which is owned by banks fell by more than half to $96 billion.At the Argentine Stock Exchange mostly the domain of brokers fixed-income volumes jumped 57% in 2020 to $247 billion.The shifts have propelled a surge in bank departures as investment professionals seek out higher wages and less regulatory scrutiny. At least a dozen prominent bankers have made the switch since mid-2019 including HSBC Plc trader Juan Manuel Truppia\xe2\x80\x99s jump to TPCG Valores. Other high-profile moves include Manuel Rocha-Nan\xe2\x80\x99s switch from head of corporate sales at Banco Galicia to Max Capital and Carolina Gialdi a fixed-income strategist at BTG Pactual who also joined Max Capital.\xe2\x80\x9cThe brokers today are fed by the banks\xe2\x80\x9d said Juan Rodriguez Braun a partner at Max Capital which increased its workforce by 25% in 2020 to 50 employees.

BloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d agoCoinDeskBitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in SiberiaMining company BitRiver is launching its own token aiming to raise $35 million on Bithumb2d agoMore Stories', b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-q1-yuan-denominated-exports-020000921.html'

(CAG Quick QuoteCAG-Free Report)posted robust third-quarter fiscal 2021 results with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were backed by increased organic sales which benefited from higher at-home consumption driving Conagra\xe2\x80\x99s retail business. This also helped the company offset softness in the Foodservice segment.Q3 in DetailConagra\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 59 cents which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. Moreover the figure increased 25.5% from the year-ago quarter\xe2\x80\x99s figure. The year-over-year upside can be mainly attributed to increased gross profit. \xc2\xa0Conagra generated net sales of $2771.1 million which advanced 8.5% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2720.3 million. The year-over-year sales growth was backed by higher organic sales partly offset by divestitures of the Lender\'s bagel business H.K. Anderson business Peter Pan peanut butter business as well as the exit of the private label peanut butter business. The divestitures are collectively referred to as the Sold Businesses.Organic sales increased 9.7% on higher volumes and favorable price/mix. Volumes were aided by elevated at-home consumption amid the coronavirus pandemic which in turn boosted Conagra\xe2\x80\x99s retail business but hurt the Foodservice segment. Also temporary supply chain disruption owing to a winter storm was a drag on the performance. Further price/mix primarily benefited from favorable mix reduced promotional activity and inflation-justified pricing in Foodservice business.CONAGRA BRANDS Price Consensus and EPS Surprise\xc2\xa0 CONAGRA BRANDS price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | CONAGRA BRANDS Quote\xc2\xa0Adjusted gross profit increased 8.9% to $761 million while adjusted gross margin expanded 12 basis points to 27.5%. The uptick can be attributed to higher sales strong productivity related to supply chain favorable margin mix fixed cost leverage and cost synergies from Pinnacle Foods\xe2\x80\x99 buyout. These were somewhat countered by costs associated with COVID-19 input cost inflation increased transportation costs as well as profit that was lost from Sold Businesses.Adjusted EBITDA improved 9.9% to $566 million backed by increase in adjusted gross profit.Adjusted selling general and administrative expense excluding advertising and promotional expense grew 5.2% to $244 million mainly due to increased incentive compensation and higher commissions expense. Nevertheless positive impacts from synergies pandemic-induced savings as well as lower travel expense offered some respite.Segmental DetailsGrocery & Snacks: Quarterly net sales in the segment came in at $1133.1 million up 10.8% year over year owing to higher organic sales. The figure was partially hurt by the Sold Businesses. Organic sales increased 13.1% with volumes and price/mix up 9.4% and 3.7% respectively on an organic basis. Volumes rose owing to consumers\xe2\x80\x99 higher at-home consumption. Management highlighted that several of the company\xe2\x80\x99s snacks and staples brands experienced strong organic sales growth. Further price/mix was mainly driven by lower promotional activity and favorable mix.Refrigerated & Frozen: Net sales advanced 11.7% to $1203.1 million. Organic sales rose 12.1% with volumes up 7.8% and price/mix growth of 4.3% on an organic basis. Higher at home consumption boosted volumes while lower promotion levels and favorable mix aided the rise in price/mix. Several brands in the segment experienced strong organic sales growth.International: Net sales rose 9% to $240.9 million on account of higher organic sales offset by unfavorable currency movements and declines from Sold Businesses. On an organic basis net sales rose 9.8% as volumes increased 6.7% and price/mix was up 3.1% on an organic basis. This was backed by higher demand amid the pandemic. In particular strong growth was witnessed in all regions across snacks staples and frozen business.

Organic sales fell 16.5% with volumes down 19.5% on an organic basis. The downside was caused by reduced restaurant traffic amid the pandemic. Nevertheless price/mix went up 3%.\xc2\xa0Other UpdatesConagra exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $80.7 million senior long-term debt (excluding current installments) of $8278.1 million and total stockholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity of $8329.8 million.

During the quarter the company repurchased nearly 8.8 million shares of its common stock for $298 million.On Jan 25 2021 the company concluded the divestitureof its Peter Pan peanut butter business.The deal is likely to reduced annual reported net sales by nearly $110 million and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by roughly 3 cents.GuidanceThe company continued to see a considerable increase in demand in the retail business in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to date. However the company continued to witness sluggish demand for foodservice products to date.
