However the basic idea behind the cloud is the same. The \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d is a euphemistic term for the delivery of different services via the internet. In its early days the cloud was used exclusively for data storage. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an easy example of why this was important.Back when the internet was cutting its teeth I worked in marketing communications. The need to comply with Total Quality Control Systems (TQCS) for our largest clients meant we had to save every version of our files. Every. Single. One.Now imagine that you\xe2\x80\x99re producing a 120-page product catalog complete with photos and charts. Your hard drive is burning up just thinking about it. Yet that \xe2\x80\x9cdata\xe2\x80\x9d had to be stored somewhere. And so we had a virtual server farm to try to warehouse all these graphic intensive (and memory sucking) files until we could archive them.Other than the storage nightmare consider that it was a pain to work remotely. You could copy a file from the server but then were you working on the right file? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure at least one person is reading this who remembers this pain.The cloud takes that away. Cloud computing allows you to store files on a secure remote server that everyone can access anywhere they have an internet connection. But it\xe2\x80\x99s become so much more than that. Cloud computing now gives businesses a platform from which they can create applications and software. If that sounds confusing I hope to simplify it in this presentation.To help you understand which cloud computing stocks you may want to add to your portfolio and we\xe2\x80\x99ve created this special presentation. These are seven of the cloud computing stocks that will continue to grow with the sector.View the "7 Cloud Computing Stocks to Lift Your Portfolio to New Heights".Free Email NewsletterComplete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:Email AddressMost Read This Week3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows Ready to Buy3 Growth Stocks Displaying Market Leadership3 Stocks with Bullish Insider ActivityViacom Stock is a Bargain Pullback Opportunity Here3 Capital Markets Stocks to Buy Now3 Sectors To Buy When The Market Pulls Back\xc2\xa0Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) IPO: 3 Things for Investors to KnowArtificial Intelligence Revolution: 3 Stocks to Automate Your GainsSemiconductor Industry Set To Benefit From Global Chip ShortageSleeping Giant Cisco Stock is Reawakening For a Huge Breakout Recent ArticlesInsteel Industries Stock is a U.S. Infrastructure Pure PlayNXP Semiconductors Looks to Carry Momentum into 20213 Dividend Stocks to Help You Fight Inflation3 Online Payment Stocks Capitalizing On Covid-Era Trends3 Consumer Defensive Stocks Delivering Tech-Like ReturnsDiscovery Networks Stock is a Becoming a Pullback Opportunity Lower3 High Margin Companies Worth BuyingThe Lovesac Hyper-Growth Story Hits New High\xc2\xa0Bed Bath & Beyond Looks Beyond its Meme Stock DaysJPMorgan Flat After Blow-Out QuarterSearch Headlines:Search ArticlesMarketBeat Minute PodcastEach market day you\'ll get a one-minute market summary to help you invest wisely.Subscribe to MarketBeat Minute30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for $1.00Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat\'s full suite of research tools:Best-in-Class Portfolio MonitoringView the latest news buy/sell ratings SEC filings and insider transactions for your stocks.

The leisure and hospitality sector that once had 15 million employees has lost 4 million jobs since February.Many major cities will be feeling the ripple effects of the Covid-19 pandemic for years. However there is ample evidence that shows the pandemic may be coming to an end. The number of new cases is dropping. The number of those getting vaccinated is rising. And even in the cities with the most restrictive mitigation measures the slow process of reopening is beginning.All of this can\xe2\x80\x99t come fast enough for individuals who rely on the travel and tourism industry for their livelihood. Hotel chains had at least some revenue coming in the door. And when earnings season concludes the more budget-friendly hotel chains may realize revenue that is 75% of its 2019 numbers. But that is not enough to bring the hotels to anywhere near full employment. Particularly with hotels that have bars and restaurants that have remained closed or open at limited capacity.Many economists are optimistic that travel may begin to look more normal by the summer of this year. And the global economy may deliver 6.4% GDP growth this year. With that in mind the hotel chains with the best fundamentals and the broadest footprint will be in the best position as the economy reopens.View the "7 Hotel Stocks Just Waiting For the Vaccine".Free Email NewsletterComplete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:Email AddressMost Read This Week3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows Ready to Buy3 Growth Stocks Displaying Market Leadership3 Stocks with Bullish Insider ActivityViacom Stock is a Bargain Pullback Opportunity Here3 Capital Markets Stocks to Buy Now3 Sectors To Buy When The Market Pulls Back\xc2\xa0Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) IPO: 3 Things for Investors to KnowArtificial Intelligence Revolution: 3 Stocks to Automate Your GainsSemiconductor Industry Set To Benefit From Global Chip ShortageSleeping Giant Cisco Stock is Reawakening For a Huge Breakout Recent ArticlesInsteel Industries Stock is a U.S. Infrastructure Pure PlayNXP Semiconductors Looks to Carry Momentum into 20213 Dividend Stocks to Help You Fight Inflation3 Online Payment Stocks Capitalizing On Covid-Era Trends3 Consumer Defensive Stocks Delivering Tech-Like ReturnsDiscovery Networks Stock is a Becoming a Pullback Opportunity Lower3 High Margin Companies Worth BuyingThe Lovesac Hyper-Growth Story Hits New High\xc2\xa0Bed Bath & Beyond Looks Beyond its Meme Stock DaysJPMorgan Flat After Blow-Out QuarterSearch Headlines:Search ArticlesMarketBeat Minute PodcastEach market day you\'ll get a one-minute market summary to help you invest wisely.Subscribe to MarketBeat Minute30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for $1.00Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat\'s full suite of research tools:Best-in-Class Portfolio MonitoringView the latest news buy/sell ratings SEC filings and insider transactions for your stocks.

Literally. My grandfather ran the Canadian movie theater chain Famous Players. Owned by Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAC)\xc2\xa0before being acquired by Cineplex (OTCMKTS:CPXGF) in June 2005 I continue to hope the pandemic hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sucked the life out of movie palaces across the globe.This is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so tough to argue AMC is more like a $5 stock at this point in the proceedings rather than a $15 one.Here\xe2\x80\x99s why.An Interesting ArgumentInvestorPlace\xe2\x80\x99s Vandita Jadeja made an interesting argument recently about the various headwinds AMC faces in the future.Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about its overall financial health or the stiff competition it faces from within the industry \xe2\x80\x94 Marcus Corp (NYSE:MCS)\xc2\xa0Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) and Cineplex to name a few \xe2\x80\x94 or the surge in video streaming during Covid-19 that\xe2\x80\x99s bound to reduce the future theatergoing audience to some extent AMC\xe2\x80\x99s prognosis is anything but good.Ten years from now I doubt we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having this conversation. Consumers will be doing a lot of the things they used to do before the pandemic. However where I live in Nova Scotia which has generally been spared from major illness due to Covid-19 there are people who still jump onto the road to avoid a passing pedestrian.I doubt that feeling will be shaken off easily even after we\xe2\x80\x99re all vaccinated and safe from the virus. Therefore places such as theaters and cruise lines where people are packed in cheek to jowl will likely continue to experience some lingering doubts. That will impede the ability to return to normal audience levels.However I have no doubt that ultimately we will return to normal leisure practices. Maybe not in 2021 but 2022 for sure.In the meantime my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s overarching argument that AMC\xe2\x80\x99s woeful finances combined with unknown future traffic suggest $10 is not the true value.The True Value of AMC StockThe last time I wrote about AMC was in early March. I concluded that there were 11 billion reasons AMC wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a $10 stock let alone $15. In the month since investors have had a tug-of-war to determine its future direction. As is often the case it went sideways remaining around $10.My biggest concern was debt. It had $11.3 billion at the end of Q3 2020. It reported Q4 2020 results the day after my article appeared. Debt was marginally higher at $11.38 billion.In terms of revenues they were $1.24 billion in 2020 down 77.3% from a year earlier. As would be expected under such a revenue implosion it had an adjusted loss per share of $16.15 down 1400% from a $1.08 loss in 2019.There was a 79% decline in attendance in 2020 81% down in the U.S. and 73% internationally. As a result its adjusted free cash flow went from $359 million in 2019 to -$1.2 billion in 2020 a $1.6 billion swing.So based on 450.2 million shares outstanding as of March 11 2021 and net debt of $11.07 billion ($11.38 billion total debt minus $308 million cash) at the end of December you get net debt per share of $24.59 or 2.5 times its current share price of $9.65.By every standard that\xe2\x80\x99s not a winning hand.In comparison Cineplex who I mentioned earlier had net debt of 1.88 billion CAD ($1.50 billion) at the end of the fourth quarter. Based on 63.33 million shares outstanding (816.37 million CAD divided by 12.89 CAD) it had net debt of 29.70 CAD per share. That\xe2\x80\x99s just 2.3 times its current share price.The Bottom LineI thought Marcus was a better buy than AMC in my last article. This time I believe Cineplex is the better buy. Both come down to the fact they have less debt.My InvestorPlace colleague Larry Ramer stated in early April that AMC\xe2\x80\x99s market capitalization is way higher than before the pandemic. In fact it\xe2\x80\x99s five or six times its market cap before Covid-19.And for what? The opportunity to watch it lose $3 a share in 2021 and 88 cents in 2022. No thank you.I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any question that AMC stock is anything other than a $5 stock. I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon enough.On the date of publication Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008. Publications where he\xe2\x80\x99s appeared include InvestorPlace The Motley Fool Canada Investopedia Kiplinger and several others in both the U.S. and Canada. He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time. He lives in Halifax Nova Scotia.

"Following" : "Follow"}}April 13 2021 1:13pm699CommentsShare:The U.S. film exhibition industry absorbed a major loss as the privately-held Decurion Corporation announced the closure of its Arclight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres chains.What Happened: The two chains have been shuttered since the COVID-19 pandemic took root in March 2020. In a statement the company announced operations will not be revived.\xe2\x80\x9cThis was not the outcome anyone wanted but despite a huge effort that exhausted all potential options the company does not have a viable way forward\xe2\x80\x9d the company said.The Pacific Theatres and Arclight brands consisted of more than 300 screens in California most notably the iconic Cinerama Dome a geodesic dome theater built in 1963 to accommodate the premiere of the slapstick epic\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\xe2\x80\x9d and featured in many notable films most recently Quentin Tarantino\'s "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." The chains also operated venues in Boston Chicago and the Washington D.C. metro area.Why It Matters: All 50 states have given the greenlight for movie theaters to move beyond the pandemic and resume operations albeit at varying levels of venue capacity. According to the National Association of Theater Owners only eight states \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Iowa Montana Nebraska Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Texas and Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0have eliminated seating restrictions and allow theaters to operate at full capacity.But for theater companies operating venues at limited capacity levels the return to pre-pandemic profitability will be a challenge.AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) reported 2020 revenue of $1.2 billion down from $5.4 billion in 2019. Cinemark Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CNK) reported $686.3 million in 2020 revenue compared to $3.2 billion one year earlier.IMAX Corp\xc2\xa0(NYSE: IMAX) took in $137 million in revenue last year compared to $395.7 million in the prior year. The privately-owned Alamo Drafthouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month after finding it impossible to service its $105 million in long-term debt.Related Link: Chinese Moviegoers Help \'Avatar\' Regain All-Time Box Office ChampionshipWhat Happens Next: Complicating matters for exhibitors is a very limited quantity of product to attract audiences back to the theaters. While \xe2\x80\x9cGodzilla vs. Kong\xe2\x80\x9d reanimated the U.S. box office with a strong $48.5 million in its first five days since opening on March 31 it is still the only box office bonanza in release.Over the past weekend \xe2\x80\x9cGodzilla vs. Kong\xe2\x80\x9d reigned at the U.S. box office with $13.3 million ticket sales a far distance from second-place \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x9d an action-thriller released by Comcast Corporation\'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Universal Pictures which took in $2.65 million. \xe2\x80\x9cGodzilla vs. Kong\xe2\x80\x9d brought in more at the box office than the other nine films in the top 10 releases combined. Not surprisingly many multiplexes have \xe2\x80\x9cGodzilla vs. Kong\xe2\x80\x9d occupying a majority of their available screens. The movie was a production of\xc2\xa0AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) subsidiary Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures Productions LLC a subsidiary of China\'s Wanda Group.The dearth of audience-bait flicks could be resolved in time for the summer film season with Paramount a ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ: VIAC) subsidiary releasing \xe2\x80\x9cA Quiet Place Part II\xe2\x80\x9d on May 28 Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) releasing \xe2\x80\x9cCruella\xe2\x80\x9d on May 28 and \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Widow\xe2\x80\x9d on July 9 and Universal unveiling \xe2\x80\x9cF9\xe2\x80\x9d the latest installment of the \xe2\x80\x9cFast and the Furious\xe2\x80\x9d franchise on June 25.However not everyone is convinced a pre-pandemic normalcy can be achieved by summer: Paramount rescheduled the Tom Cruise action film \xe2\x80\x9cTop Gun: Maverick\xe2\x80\x9d from July 2 to Nov.\xc2\xa019 while rescheduling another Cruise title \xe2\x80\x9cMission: Impossible 7\xe2\x80\x9d from Nov.\xc2\xa019 to May 27 2022.Adding to the uncertainty of film exhibition is whether audiences will watch films at home rather than pay to see them on a big screen. At the moment streaming does not seem to be stealing audiences. \xe2\x80\x9cGodzilla vs. Kong\xe2\x80\x9d has been available for free viewing to HBO Max subscribers while playing in theaters but whether the theaters can muscle out the threat from streaming remains to be seen.Related Link: Netflix Pays Reported $450M For \'Knives Out\' Sequels(Photo of the Cinerama Dome by Steve Boland / Flickr Creative Commons.)\xc2\xa9 2021 Benzinga.com.
