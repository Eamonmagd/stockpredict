"Bandhan Bank has reported better-than-expected AUM growth of 21% yoy/8% qoq to Rs802bn (provisional) on a high base primarily driven by better disbursement trends in MFI small business loans and mortgages in our view. Q4 is seasonally a strong quarter for lenders with a sizeable MFI portfolio. Creditaccess (18% yoy/14% qoq) Ujjivan (7% yoy/11% qoq) and Satin Creditcare (1% yoy/5% qoq) too have reported healthy growth as per their business updates" Emkay Global Financial Services has stated.Deposits growth remained strong at 37% yoy/10% qoq to Rs780bn (a phenomenon seen across banks) given the bank\'s strong liability franchise. CASA ratio improved by 50bps qoq/660bps yoy to 43.4%. Deposits are now 90% of AUM vs. 79% in Q4FY20 leading to lower CoF and thus being structurally long-term positive for NIMs. "Amid concerns around the asset quality due to waiver announcements in Assam and elections in Assam/WB the bank has reported slightly better overall collections at ~96% (EEB-Microfinance at 95% vs. 90% in Jan\'20 ? after slip down in Assam ? and 92% in Dec\'20 in value terms). We seek more clarity on collection efficiency specifically in Assam/WB. Collection efficiency in the non-EEB portfolio was robust at 98%" Emkay Global Financial Services has stated.The bank has strategically created a strong provisioning buffer to absorb any asset quality shocks. The cumulative contingent buffer stands at Rs27.4bn 3.1% of AUM. We expect the bank to largely absorb the Assam related asset quality pain upfront in Q4 through the provisioning buffer (Collection efficiency in Assam in Jan\'21 was ~89%). With the second wave of Covid-19 surging we expect the bank to make some additional provisions which may result in moderate profitability in Q4. "We like Bandhan\'s strategy to diversify the asset portfolio away from MFI (product as well as geography-wise) in the wake of rising adverse asset quality events while creating strong provisioning/capital buffers. After the recent correction the stock is trading at reasonable valuations of 2x FY23 ABV. Currently we have a Buy rating on the stock" the broking firm has stated.More BANDHAN BANK NewsBandhan Bank Dips 13% In 2 Days; Analysts See Upto 59% Upside10 Stock Picks From HDFC Securities For 20217 Stock Ideas For Short Term And Long Term GainsRBI Lifts Curbs Placed On Bandhan Bank Promoter Cuts StakeCaladium Investments Ups Stake In Bandhan Bank; Stock Trades 1.8% HigherBandhan Bank Falls 9% On Block Deals By PromoterGoldman Sachs Cuts Earning Outlook For Indian Banks By 40% On AvgBandhan Bank Deposits Rose 32% In Jan-Mar QuarterBandhan Bank Jumps 35% IndusInd Bank Jumps 40% In A Single DayBandhan Bank Jumps 5% After RBI Permits Branch ExpansionBandhan Bank Reports 120% Increase In Q3 Profit; Asset Quality DeclinesBandhan Bank Market Cap Touches Rs 1 Lakh CroreFor investment related articles business news and mutual fund adviseAllow NotificationsYou have already subscribedCommentsRead more about:bandhan bank stock stocks investment investmentsStory first published: Wednesday April 14 2021 13:40 [IST]Other articles published onApr 14 20215 Key Takeaways From TCS Q4FY21 ResultsPharma Only Outlier Amid Weak Market; Up Over 1 percentSensex Sinks 1587 Points: Here\xe2\x80\x99s What Is Triggering LossesFeatured PostsCompany SearchEquity Mutual fundIFSC CodeCurrencyFD\xc2\xa0CalculatorSelect BankSelect StateSelect CitySelect BranchFromINR -

(Netflix)Overwhelmed by Peak TV? Aaron Barnhart is your guide to the good the great and the skippable.Subscribeto get all his Primetimer reviews.Once upon a time there was a TV network called the WB and its mascot was a frog. Michigan J. Frog to be exact a character from an old Warner Bros. cartoon who occasionally broke into an Al Jolson routine. Kind of an odd choice for a late-20th-century mascot but he was cheap to license and in those money-losing early years of the WB that was nothing to croak about. Why was there even a WB network anyway? Because in the early \xe2\x80\x9990s the federal government lifted its longtime ban on networks owning studios. Sensing a new gold rush media bigwigs converted scores of indie TV stations across North America into WB affiliates hoping to turn low-cost content into fast cash.Well the frog did not become a handsome prince and things did not end happily ever after. The WB found itself upstaged by dozens of cable channels that began spending massively on TV production. Ultimately the WB and rival mini-network UPN were merged into the CW which is still around.... mostly. Still the WB\xe2\x80\x99s decade or so on the air was not without its storybook moments. There was Buffy and Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s and Charmed and in its earliest years the WB gave us Steve Harvey and Jamie Foxx.The year was 1996. The WB\xe2\x80\x99s first prime-time lineup had arrived the year before \xe2\x80\x94 ten comedies on Sunday and Wednesday nights \xe2\x80\x94 and most of them failed. They failed to be distinct from the usual network fare and they failed to find an audience. (Historically WB/UPN/CW shows have finished at the very bottom of the Nielsen TV ratings but were targeted at a small and potentially lucrative slice of the viewing audience usually young adults.) There were two exceptions from that first season though. Both were \xe2\x80\x9curban sitcoms\xe2\x80\x9d in the coded industry parlance for comedies with mostly Black talent. One was the Mowry twins\xe2\x80\x99 Sister Sister the other was The Wayans Bros. with Keenen and Damon Wayans best known for their breakthrough sketch show In Living Color.Outside of HBO almost no TV shows at the time had Black men or women in leading roles. Jamie Kellner the first network chief at the WB had put In Living Color on Fox so he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised that the WB\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9curban sitcoms\xe2\x80\x9d had found an audience. And he ordered three more for the fall of 1996: The Parent \xe2\x80\x99Hood with Robert Townsend The Steve Harvey Show and The Jamie Foxx Show. Townsend was the best-known of the three initially thanks to his film credits (Hollywood Shuffle The Five Heartbeats). But Harvey and Foxx were rising comics who if they were white probably would\xe2\x80\x99ve been starring in sitcoms already. Other than the race of the stars there was little notable about any of these early WB sitcoms but they all had respectable runs and it was after all network television. For Harvey and Foxx these eponymous shows would wind up launching them into the next stratosphere of fame.And now one of them is back in the sitcom business. In the two decades since his run at the WB Jamie Foxx has picked up an Oscar laid down a double-platinum record and amassed a body of acting work that reflects consistently good choices whether in drama or action or animation. So why is he starring in something called Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!?Well aside from the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s Netflix which puts the $$ in show busine$$ I\xe2\x80\x99ll put out this wild guess. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet that Jamie Foxx knows that his show on the WB wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that good. And that if he and his showrunner Bentley Kyle Evans \xe2\x80\x94 who was also his showrunner on The Jamie Foxx Show \xe2\x80\x94 had more creative freedom back then and a little more mileage under their belts they\xe2\x80\x99d have made a better show.And guess what? They have! But you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to be patient with Dad Stop Embarrassing Me because like many sitcoms this one is being tuned as it goes along. For the first 15 minutes or so of the pilot episode I was staring stone-faced at the screen. Nothing funny or interesting was coming out of the very stock characters\xe2\x80\x99 mouths. And then at some point \xe2\x80\x94 I think it was when the mariachi band showed up \xe2\x80\x94 I laughed out loud. And the laughs kept coming. By the middle of the second episode I was absolutely helpless.So here\xe2\x80\x99s the setup: Foxx plays Brian Dixon an Atlanta businessman living single. He inherited a cosmetics business from his late mother and a teenage daughter named Sasha (played by Kyla-Drew) from his ex-wife who has recently passed. His father a pot-smoking ex-con played by David Alan Grier lives out back in the pool house. His sister Chelsea (Porscha Coleman) comes over to annoy him and to hook up with his white buddy a cop named Johnny (Jonathan Kite).The pilot opens with Brian and Sasha in therapy \xe2\x80\x94 sex therapy it turns out the result of a Huge Misunderstanding that probably was funnier on paper. Between the sitcommy repetition of lines to amp up the hilarity (e.g. saying \xe2\x80\x9cBlack people don\xe2\x80\x99t go to therapy\xe2\x80\x9d over and over) and the multi-camera laugh-track format (at least I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s a laugh track since it was filmed during the pandemic) I did feel like I was watching a not very good throwback urban comedy at first.Although it's called Dad Stop Embarrassing Me the adult banter and plumes of reefer are tells that this is no family sitcom. In an early scene Brian wards off the aggressive moves of a sexy employee then pivots to the camera and tells viewers \xe2\x80\x9cBack in the day I would try to knock all the spice off that jerk chicken!\xe2\x80\x9d According to Netflix the show \xe2\x80\x9cis inspired by Foxx\xe2\x80\x99s real-life relationship with daughter Corinne Foxx\xe2\x80\x9d although Chuck Lorre\xe2\x80\x99s popular sex comedies for CBS are also clearly an influence. And when Foxx breaks the fourth wall it reminds me of nothing so much as another classic Black sitcom The Bernie Mac Show (which you may or may not recall was created by Larry Wilmore himself heading back into the sitcom arena).Foxx is multitalented so we see him sing do impressions and even play different characters. In my opinion though neither Foxx nor his eye-rolling daughter is what makes this show stand out. For that I give credit to David Alan Grier who\xe2\x80\x99s sporting a Harry Edwards look these days and is channeling another Foxx namely Redd in his role as grizzled old Pops. Grier can take lines like \xe2\x80\x9cThree death-row inmates requested my gumbo as their last meal because I cook it real slow\xe2\x80\x9d and extract full hilarity from them not an easy thing.Also you know a show is adjusting on the fly when a \xe2\x80\x9crecurring character\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly starts getting more lines than some cast members. Here it\xe2\x80\x99s Heather Hemmens (If Loving You Is Wrong) who plays Stacy an employee of Brian\xe2\x80\x99s and once again an inappropriate love interest for him. She\xe2\x80\x99s also a good soul a good listener and a bridge between father and daughter \xe2\x80\x94 just what this show full of abrasive personalities needed.I realize that saying Dad Stop Embarrassing Me! is better than a 25-year-old WB sitcom is not exactly high praise. So I will also say it\xe2\x80\x99s better than most other recent Netflix sitcoms (Country Comfort comes to mind) and that I admire how it incorporates racial issues that are on the minds of everyone who will be watching this show in 2021. And the season is blessedly short with just eight 22-minute episodes to get through \xe2\x80\x94 seven if you skip the less-than-stellar pilot.

Volumes reduced to 503.52 million from 688.03 million in the last trading session.Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said stocks closed bearish amid pressure in overbought scrips on concerns over economic uncertainty and reports of over Rs6.0 trillion tax collection target for FY22 which was likely to impact corporate earnings.IMF and WB projections on lower growth at 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively in FY21 amid surging public debt circular debt and weak economic outlook due to ongoing pandemic dragged the index down Mehanti added.As many as 387 scrips were active of which 130 advanced 234 declined and 23 remained unchanged. A A H Soomro at KASB Securities said investors were anxious over the Covid infection rate and number of cases in the short term despite strong medium term outlook.\xe2\x80\x9cCovid cases have been north of 5000 for 4 out of past 5 days with improvement witnessed on Sunday. However government officials - Dr Faisal Sultan and Asad Umar - have voiced their concerns that SOPs are not being followed and the hospitalisation levels are increasing day by day to alarming levels of infection rate\xe2\x80\x9d Soomro added.An analyst said the market took hit from the possibility of imposition of lockdown in thelight of NCOC proposal although a firm decision was yet to be taken.Selling pressure was evident across the board with the exception of few scrips including TRG Pakistan Ghani Global MCB Bank and Fauji Fertilizer which somewhat supported the index. Refinery sector which had lately coincided with technology stocks also went down following weak investor sentiment the analyst added.Kohat Cement up 0.7 percent announced its 9MFY21 earnings per share (EPS) of Rs12.60 versus a loss of Rs1.41/share in the same period last year with no cash pay-out.On the economic front remittances from Pakistani workers employed abroad exceeded $2 billion for the 10th consecutive month as they clocked in at $2.7 billion for March up 43 percent from a year earlier.Furthermore Pakistan Petroleum up 0.04 percent has received a pay order for Rs903.218 million from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against long outstanding receivables from Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited.Going forward the market would take cue from Covid cases and earnings announcements.

The health department said it will carry out several initiatives to raise awareness around vaccination.Unlike other states there is no shortage of vaccine doses but a surplus. On average RGGGH and Government Medical College Hospital Omandurar Estate vaccinate up to 500 persons a day but in many cities districts and rural parts only 25 to 40 people are vaccinated.The Tamil Nadu government has been testing over 80000 samples everyday.

These two international financial institutions (IFIs) created in 1944 are dominated by the United States and a few major allied powers that act to generalize policies contrary to the interests of the people.The WB and the IMF have systematically lent to states in order to influence their policies. External debt has been and still is used as an instrument of subordination of debtors. Since their creation the IMF and WB have violated international covenants on human rights and do not hesitate to support dictatorships.A new form of decolonization is needed to break the deadlock in which the IFIs and their main shareholders have trapped the world in general. New international institutions must be built. We are publishing a series of articles by \xc3\x89ric Toussaint that retraces the evolution of the WB and the IMF since their creation in 1944.ContentsFalse explanationsCriticisms of the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s diagnostic of the Arab spring eventsThe World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s contortions around income inequality and the Kuznets curveThe WB has not changed its outlook on the Arab regionWhilst the World BankWorld BankWBThe World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states\xe2\x80\x99 contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.It consists of several closely associated institutions among which :1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD 189 members in 2017) which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;2. The International Development Association (IDA 159 members in 1997) which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.As Third World Debt gets worse the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries\xe2\x80\x99 payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates.and the IMFIMFInternational Monetary FundAlong with the World Bank the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.As for the World Bank a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 1768%\xc2\xa0% of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (1674%) Japan (623%) Germany (581%) France (429%) and the UK (429%).The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (657% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (155% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.http://imf.orgpraised the authoritarian or dictatorial regimes in power for many decades in the Arab regions the embers / cinders of revolt were ready to flare upZine el-Abidine Ben Ali president of the Tunisian Republic from 1987 to 2011 (CC - Wikimedia)The main analyses by the two financial institutions concerning Tunisia and Egypt thetwo countries where popular revolt arose betweenDecember 2010 and January 2011commended the Ben Aliand Moubarak leaderships (in power for 24 and 30 years respectively). The two despots although faithful allies of the Western powers who were forced to abandon their positions in January 2011 had unfailingly applied the neoliberal policies promoted by the World Bank (WB) and the IMF.The WB makes no serious analysis of its errorsTen years later t here is no official World Bank analysis that would help to understand the roots of the uprisings / revolts. Not only does the WB continue blindly in its errors it produces half-baked studies trying to justify them.The WB and the IMF clearly have a problem: If as they say their recommendations are going in the right direction and they must be pressed harder how can the vigorous popular movements that have rocked the Arab World from Morocco to Yemen and Lebanon be explained? At the moment of writing these lines the Arab populations have been expressing their discontent for over a decade.The discrepancies between the WB\xe2\x80\x99s previsions and the achieved results cannot be ignoredHosni Moubarak president of the arab Republic of Egypt from 1981 to 2011 (CC - Wikimedia)The discrepancies between the WB\xe2\x80\x99s previsions and the achieved results are such that they cannot be ignored. The WB was forced to make unconvincing public relation declarations to explain that such events had not been foreseen / anticipated.Several WB citations such as the following press release from October 2015 show they are incapable of understanding where the revolt came from:\xe2\x80\x9cJudging by economic data alone the revolutions of the 2011 Arab Spring should have never happened. The numbers from the decades before had told a glowing story: the region had been making steady progress toward eliminating extreme poverty boosting shared prosperity increasing school enrollment and reducing hunger child and maternal mortality. Reforms were underway and economic growth was moderate.And then in late 2010 and early 2011 millions of people poured onto the streets of major cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) calling for change and the Arab street began to tell a story that standard quantitative indicators had not foreseen\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[1].The WB admits to a profound misunderstanding of the realities of the Arab region and bends over backwards to try to explain why the population revolted in spite of the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom and apparently successful advice to the ruling authoritarian regimes.False explanationsJust the title of the above mentioned press release is edifying: \xe2\x80\x9cMiddle-class Frustration Fueled the Arab Spring\xe2\x80\x9d. The WB affirms that poverty and inequalities were on a downward trend before 2011; there was progress in \xe2\x80\x9cboosting shared prosperity\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing school enrolment and reducing hunger and child and maternal mortality.\xe2\x80\x9d According to the WB the middle classes were discontent at not getting what they considered to be their fair shareShareA unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock. Its owner (a shareholder) is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed (a dividend) and to attend shareholder meetings.of the abundance.Flouting the facts the World Bank claims that poverty and inequalities had a downward trend before 2011The WB says that the poorest 40% of the population were much less discontented than the middle classes and had no need to take to the streets. This is clearly contrary to the circumstances that ignited the street protests in Tunisia where the movement started.Recall that on 17 December 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi a young street vendor set fire to himself in desperation of having his wares confiscated by the police. It was the start of demonstrations gathering hundreds of thousands of the popular classes and especially the poorest. It was not only the middle classes that revolted. The Bank\xe2\x80\x99s explanations are not at all convincing as several critics have demonstrated.Place Tahrir Egypt 1st February 2011 (CC - Flickr - @Peta_de_Aztlan)On the beginnings of the Arab spring in Tunisia and Egypt:TUNISIA 17 December 2010: Mohammed Bouazizi a young street vendorin Sidi Bouzid set fire to himself in desperation of having his wares confiscated by the police. It was the start of a wave of protests. 11 January 2011: confrontations in Tunis. 14 January: President Ben Ali in power since 1987 flees to Saudi Arabia.EGYPT 25 January2011: First demonstration on the Place Tahrir in Cairo. This marks the beginning of several weeks of uprising to bring down the regime. 11 February: President Hosni Moubarak in power since 1981 resigns.Criticisms of the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s diagnostic of the Arab spring eventsGilbert Achcar author of several indispensable books on the Arab region (North Africa and Middle East) as well as the Arab Spring\xc2\xa0[2] demonstrated in a well-documented study published in 2020\xc2\xa0[3] that World Bank affirmations are unfounded. Achcar shows that it is untrue to say that the levels of inequality were less important in the Arab region than in most of the other developing regions of the World. Achcar\xe2\x80\x99s studies show that income inequalities increased in North Africa and the Middle-East between 1980 and 2011. The incomes of the popular classes decreased whilst the incomes and net values of the richest increased.Income inequalities increased in North Africa and the Middle-East between 1980 and 2011The World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s methods of collecting income and household spending data are quite unsure as they are compiled from a very limited number of samples. The conclusions that are drawn are clearly in contradiction with the observed effects of their policies. The CADTM will devote a future article to the flaws in World Bank figures.In collecting income and household spending data the World Bank uses a very limited number of samplesIn works published between 2014 and 2018 that cover the period from 1990 to 2016 Piketty Facundo Alvaredo and Lydia Assouaddispute the claims by the World bank that the Middle-East is less unequal than other parts of the World. According to Piketty and his two colleagues: \xe2\x80\x9c...the Middle East appears to be the most unequal region in the world with a top decile income share as large as 64 percent compared to 37 percent in Western Europe 47 percent in the US and 55 percent in Brazil\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0[4]...the Middle East appears to be the most unequal region in the world with a top decile income share as large as 64 percent compared to 37 percent in Western Europe 47 percent in the US and 55 percent in BrazilFurther on (p. 17) the authors state \xe2\x80\x9cthe top percentile income share is about 30 percent in the Middle East vs. 12 percent in Western Europe 20 percent in the US 28 percent in Brazil 18 percent in South Africa 14 percent in China and 21 percent in India.\xe2\x80\x9dThe study made by Gilbert Achcar along with that of Piketty Facundo Alvaredo and Lydia Assouad firmly contradicts World Bank declarations clearly made in haste to disqualify intense criticism.The authors of the criticized World Bank studies Vladimir Hlasny and Paolo Verme rather than defend their study on a scientific basis preferred to accuse Achcar and Piketty et al of creating a political issue of it rather than debating a technical one. They say \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert Achcar\xe2\x80\x99s critical review concludes that the research of the protagonists of the \xe2\x80\x98Arab Inequality Puzzle\xe2\x80\x99 debate exhibits a systematic neoliberal bias and a wilful blindness to the fact that \xe2\x80\x98their recipes were responsible\xe2\x80\xa6for the formidable socio-political explosion of the Arab Spring and the protracted destabilization of the region\xe2\x80\x99 (p. 768). We argue that Achcar\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is erroneous and based on a misleading interpretation of evidence selective review of existing studies false grouping of scholars and an inadequate understanding of the measurement of income inequality. The review appears to be an attempt to politicize what has otherwise been a healthy technical debate on income inequality in Egypt\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0[5] To be precise Achcar\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms are directed at the WB\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect analysis of the Arab region and Egypt in particular. He denounces the fact that the analyses are made on the basis of data furnished by official sources monitored by authoritarian regimes.World Bank analyses are made on the basis of data furnished by official sources monitored by authoritarian regimesGilbert Achcar replied to the WB authors as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is astonishing indeed that anyone could uphold the claim that the discussion about a topic such as the validity of official data under authoritarian regimes and the causality of major popular uprisings against these same regimes is purely \xe2\x80\x98technical\xe2\x80\x99 and one which econometricians alone should engage in to the exclusion of political economists and all other social scientists \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention social and political activists who often know more about their countries than foreign \xe2\x80\x98experts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0[6]Demonstration in support of Mohamed Bouazizi and political prisoners Paris France January 15 2011 (CC - Wikimedia)The World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s contortions around income inequality and the Kuznets curveIt should be noted that the Bank does not consider a rising level of inequality as negative. Indeed it adopts the theory developed in the 1950s by the economist Simon Kuznets\xc2\xa0[7] according to which a country whose economy takes off and progresses must necessarily go through a phase of increasing inequality. According to this dogma inequality will start to fall as soon as the country has reached a higher threshold of development. It is a version of pie in the sky used by the ruling classes to to opiate the oppressed on whom they impose a life of suffering.The World Bank does not consider a rising level of inequality to be negativeThe need for rising inequalities is well rooted into the WB. Eugene Black WB President in April 1961 said: \xe2\x80\x9cIncome inequalities are the natural result of the economic growth which is thepeoples escape route from an existence of poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[8] However empirical studies by the WB in the 1970s at the time of Hollis Chenery contradict Kuznets.Income inequalities are the natural result of economic growthThe WB began to study the issue of inequality of income distribution in developing countries as an element influencing development possibilities only as from 1973. The economics team led by Hollis Chenery devoted a great deal of energy to this issue. The WB\xe2\x80\x99s major book on the subject Redistribution with Growth\xc2\xa0[9]was coordinated by Chenery himself. It was published in 1974. Chenery was aware that the type of growth induced by the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s lending policy generates inequality. The WB\xe2\x80\x99s concern was expressed repeatedly in no uncertain terms by McNamara: \xe2\x80\x9cif inequality is not reduced if poverty is not reduced there will be repeated social explosions and these will be detrimental to the interests of the free world whose leadership is provided by the United States.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever after Chenery\xe2\x80\x99s departure in 1982 and his replacement by Anne Krueger a neo-liberal conservative economist the WB completely abandoned concern about rising or maintained inequality to the point that it stopped publishing data on this subject in the World Development Report. Anne Krueger does not hesitate to take up again the Kuznets curve making rising inequality a condition for the start of growth on the doubtful basis that the means of the rich fuel investment.In Capital in the 21st Century\xc2\xa0[10] Thomas Piketty presents a very interesting analysis of the Kuznets curve.Piketty mentions that at first Kuznets himself doubted the real interestInterestAn amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender. Interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set.of the curve. That did not stop him from developing an economic theory that keeps bouncing back and like all economists that serve orthodoxy well receiving the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (1971). Since then inequalities have reached levels never before seen in the history of humanity. This is the result of the dynamism of global capitalism and the support it receives from International Institutions who are charged with \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment\xe2\x80\x9d and governments that favour the interests of the 1% over those of the enormous mass of the population as much in the developed countries as in the others.When we analyze the World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s position on the Arab Spring we see that they hold strong on to the dogma that inequalities are good for development.We may say here that the WB\xe2\x80\x99s considerations on the Arab Spring are caught in equivocations: it maintains that the levels of inequality are less important in the Arab region and that is a worrying symptom that things are not as they should be in the supposed economic success of the region. As faithful disciples of the Kuznets theories Vladimir Hlasny and Paolo Verme declare \xe2\x80\x9clow inequality was not an indicator of a healthy economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[11]Gilbert Achcar sums up the position adopted by Paolo Verme as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cin the view of the 2014 World Bank study it is inequality aversion not inequality per se that should be deplored since inequality must inevitably rise with development from a Kuznetsian perspective. Had GDPGDPGross Domestic ProductGross Domestic Product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added. The measure is notoriously incomplete; for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange. The GDP takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services. Economic growth is defined as the variation of the GDP from one period to another.growth been accompanied by a trickle\xe2\x80\x90down effect the Egyptians would have had a more positive view of inequality as \xe2\x80\x98people can hardly appreciate inequality if their own status and the status of their peers do not improve\xe2\x80\x99 (Verme et al. 2014: 97\xc2\xa0[12]). Following the same logic in order to conform to the Kuznets curve it is more inequality rather than less that Egypt needs(\xe2\x80\xa6)\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0[13]>quote>According to the World Bank aversion to inequality not inequality per se is to be deplored since inequality must inevitably increase with developmentIt should be added that the WB pretends against all evidence that the poorest were not one of the main social sectors to participate in the action against the authoritarian regimes in place and their anti-social policies. It is important for the Bank to say this because it is supposed to bring assistance to the poor. Given that in the fantasy world as imagined by the World Bank the level of poverty was low it is not possible that it was the poorest who rose up in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011. According to World Bank experts it was the middle classes who mobilized to protest against the insufficient progress in their living conditions. According to the Bank this insufficient progress was due to the State which was still interfering too much in the economy and mismanaging public affairs.The World Bank and the IMF give their total support to authoritarian regimesWhat is more the WB and IMF need scapegoats they do not hesitate to denounce and criticize as authoritarian and corrupt despots that they have upheld up to the last moment.The WB has not changed its outlook on the Arab regionTen years after the Arab Spring the WB and IMF are still compelling the countries concerned to apply the policies in place before the events and that were their root cause. For them large sectors of the economy are in need of privatization free market access more favourable regulations to attract foreign investment and the government merely regulating the free play of market forces.For the Bank and the IMF a large proportion of public enterprises should be privatized and the government should simply regulate the free play of market forcesPublic-private partnerships are also to be encouraged even though it is well known that such structures are more favourable to investment interests than to the public interest. The bank says \xe2\x80\x9cWhat MENA governments need to do is open markets to competition introduce public-private partnerships and revitalize segments of their economies that have been inefficient or dormant altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[14]In the same document the Bank affirms \xe2\x80\x9cGovernments playing their rightful role need to make an immense effort to equip their youth to grow and compete in an ever more globalized world.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words; youth must be prepared to compete against each other in offering their work capacity to private employers. According to the WB public creation of well-paid high quality socially useful jobs is to be avoided at all costs Business is quite capable of doing that and would be able to satisfy \xe2\x80\x9csuitable\xe2\x80\x9d employees.The World Bank wants the young to be more competitive and considers women from the perspective of their \xe2\x80\x9cperformance\xe2\x80\x9dAgain in this document we read that women are better \xe2\x80\x9dperformers\xe2\x80\x9d (sic) so authorities should adopt policies that draw more women into employment.\xc2\xa0[15]Next the Bank suggests that social measures are too costly:\xe2\x80\x9cMENA governments must also rethink their approach to social protection which has been sought through policies that rely on costly misguided subsidies. For too long States have chosen the politically easy and economically disastrous path to a flawed social contract whereby basic goods and services are made available at \xe2\x80\x9cprotected\xe2\x80\x9d prices to buy political allegiances and \xe2\x80\x98social peace\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d It thus pushes for reductions in socially useful subventions.The Bank concludes its neoliberal dogma with: \xe2\x80\x9cTo avoid another lost decade a loud wakeup call needs to resonate all across MENA \xe2\x80\x93 from the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean to the Gulf\xe2\x80\x9d. The immediate task is to open the door to private enterprise win over the resistance to liberalizing economies and empower youth with opportunities to match their limitless potential.\xe2\x80\x9d Amen!It must be underlined that the WB generally continues to support authoritarian regimes in the region. In particular it supports Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s criminal Abdel Fattah al-Sissi regime in place since 2014 and considers the authoritarian monarchy in Morocco as an example to be followed.In criticizing the World Bank the IMF and the governments of the region the CADTM affirms that to avoid another decade of lost hopes and disillusionment awareness is needed across the whole region from the Atlantic to the Gulf. The peoples of the region must continue the action they have undertaken since 2011 by self-organizing and creating governments that make a radical break with both the capitalist system and its neoliberal version and carry out profound social reforms in favour of justice and emancipation from all forms of oppression whether patriarchal religious or otherwise.The author thanks Omar Aziki Brigitte Ponet Claude Qu\xc3\xa9mar and Milan Rivi\xc3\xa9 for their constructive advice.An upcoming article will consider the situation in the MENA during the period from the 1950s to the end of the 1970s then the effects of the generalisation of neoliberal policies recommended by the BM and IMF from 1980 to 2011 and the continuation of the same policies up to the present day.Translate by Mike Krolikowski and ChristinePagnoulle.The World Bank: an ABCThe International Monetary Fund (IMF): an ABCConcerning the founding of the Bretton Woods\xe2\x80\x99 InstitutionsThe WB assists those in power in a witch-hunting contextEarly conflicts between the UN and the World Bank/IMF tandemSUNFED versus World BankWhy the Marshall Plan ?Why the 1953 cancellation of German debt won\xe2\x80\x99t be reproduced for Greece and Developing CountriesDomination of the United States on the World BankWorld Bank and IMF support to dictatorshipsThe World Bank and the PhilippinesThe World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s support of the dictatorship in Turkey (1980-1983)The World Bank and the IMF in Indonesia: an emblematic interferenceTheoretical lies of the World BankThe South Korean miracle is exposedThe debt trapThe World Bank saw the debt crisis loomingThe Mexican debt crisis and the World BankThe World Bank and the IMF: the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 bailiffsPresidents Barber Conable and Lewis Preston (1986-1995)James Wolfensohn switches on the charm (1995-2005)The Meltzer Commission on the IFI at the US Congress in 2000The World Bank\xe2\x80\x99s accountsFrom Paul Wolfowitz (2005-2007) to David Malpass (2019-...): the US President\xe2\x80\x99s men control the World BankWorld Bank and IMF: 76 Years is Enough!
