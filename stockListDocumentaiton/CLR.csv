These may be stocks that aren\xe2\x80\x99t associated with exceptional growth; some may be dividend stocks.But there\xe2\x80\x99s something different about normal this time around. If it\xe2\x80\x99s true (and I think it is) that the old rules no longer apply investors need to change the way they think about bellwether stocks. Plus let\xe2\x80\x99s face it many stocks that we might consider to be bellwether stocks have already had a bit of a vaccine rally. That means that the easy gains are gone.With that in mind we\xe2\x80\x99ve put together this special presentation that highlights seven of what may be termed the new bellwether stocks. These are stocks that investors should be paying attention to as the economy continues to reopen.One quality of many of these stocks is that they are either negative for 2021 or underperforming the broader market. And that means that they are likely to have a strong upside as the economy grows.View the "7 Bellwether Stocks Signaling a Return to Normal".Free Email NewsletterComplete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:Email AddressMost Read This Week3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows Ready to Buy3 Growth Stocks Displaying Market Leadership3 Stocks with Bullish Insider ActivityViacom Stock is a Bargain Pullback Opportunity Here3 Capital Markets Stocks to Buy Now3 Sectors To Buy When The Market Pulls Back\xc2\xa0Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) IPO: 3 Things for Investors to KnowArtificial Intelligence Revolution: 3 Stocks to Automate Your GainsSemiconductor Industry Set To Benefit From Global Chip ShortageSleeping Giant Cisco Stock is Reawakening For a Huge Breakout Recent ArticlesInsteel Industries Stock is a U.S. Infrastructure Pure PlayNXP Semiconductors Looks to Carry Momentum into 20213 Dividend Stocks to Help You Fight Inflation3 Online Payment Stocks Capitalizing On Covid-Era Trends3 Consumer Defensive Stocks Delivering Tech-Like ReturnsDiscovery Networks Stock is a Becoming a Pullback Opportunity Lower3 High Margin Companies Worth BuyingThe Lovesac Hyper-Growth Story Hits New High\xc2\xa0Bed Bath & Beyond Looks Beyond its Meme Stock DaysJPMorgan Flat After Blow-Out QuarterSearch Headlines:Search ArticlesMarketBeat Minute PodcastEach market day you\'ll get a one-minute market summary to help you invest wisely.Subscribe to MarketBeat Minute30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for $1.00Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat\'s full suite of research tools:Best-in-Class Portfolio MonitoringView the latest news buy/sell ratings SEC filings and insider transactions for your stocks.
