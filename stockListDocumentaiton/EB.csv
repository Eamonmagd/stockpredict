Learn moreJOINIf you\xe2\x80\x99re still desperate to buy a PS5 new stock is expected to go on sale sometime this week at stores like Big W EB Games and Amazon.It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that five months into the launch of the PlayStation 5 gamers are still struggling to secure one of the bloody things. The last update we mentioned was that Big W was perhaps preparing for a fresh intake of new stock but now it seems that things are slightly more promising.Mysterious sources close to Press Start are reporting that shipments of the new console actually arrived on our shores last week. As a result the same sources believe that means local retailers will be able to start selling them to consumers at any point within the next 7-14 days.There were no specifics given as to who will possess said stock but we\xe2\x80\x99d take a pretty big stab that it includes all the usual suspects like Amazon Big W Target and EB Games. JB Hi-Fi will likely also get a new influx but as we\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned in the past there are already plenty of people on the wait list who will beat you to the punch.Check out some upcoming PS5 games below:Before you go getting your hopes up be warned. Sounds like this new shipment will be annoyingly small as per usual.

Just look at the sky-high pricing.And because the auto business is so big\xe2\x80\x94trillions are spent every year worldwide at dealers mechanic shops gas stations and parts suppliers\xe2\x80\x94anything that happens to one part of the car business including used-car pricing has a ripple effect that impacts millions of people.Consumers looking for a cheap ride might suffer sticker shock. But investors should be afraid of higher prices.How the bubble came to be isn\xe2\x80\x99t so hard to understand: the pandemic plus parts shortages along with strong demand and low dealer inventories is the perfect equation.The Manheim used-car index a key industry pricing gauge is at an all-time high\xe2\x80\x94up about 32% year over year. The index dipped after the global economy locked down last year\xe2\x80\x94and sales for both new and used cars fell. The strength of the recovery though has been really surprising.A big driver of the rise in pricing is supply\xe2\x80\x94there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough inventory. A global microchip shortage is making it tough for dealers to keep their lots filled. New-car dealer inventories were already low to begin with because of the pandemic. Car sales fell in 2020 but so did car production. Now car sales are on fire. U.S. auto sales came in at an annualized rate of almost 18 million in March the highest level since 2017.That industry setup is good for a host of auto-related stocks.Car makers such asGeneral Motors(ticker: GM) warned that a global chip shortage would be a drag on profits. But GM and others will probably make up some of the lost profits with higher prices. What\xe2\x80\x99s more Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas believes the delayed purchase gratification in 2021 will mean the automotive cycle extends into 2022.And auto finance companies such asAlly(ALLY) stand to benefit from higher used-car values because there\xe2\x80\x99s little risk or losing money on a loan when residual used-car values are at records.New- and used-car pricing sets the pricing for a host of other businesses\xe2\x80\x94 car parts sellers such asAdvance Auto Parts(AAP) as well as salvage companies such asLKQ(LKQ).Dealers are helped too. They might like to sell more cars with better inventory levels but they also benefit from strong demand and higher selling spreads on new and used cars. \xe2\x80\x9cMany [dealers are] reporting new vehicles selling at list-plus\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Jonas in a recent research report. He says customers are paying thousands over sticker prices to drive a new car off the lot.But bubbles can be bad especially when they pop. They create losses for people buying assets at higher levels and erode investor confidence. Jefferies strategist Sean Darby used the word \xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d in a Monday report about used car-pricing and wondered if soaring prices could eventually consumer-discretionary stocks\xe2\x80\x94cars are consumer-discretionary items.\xe2\x80\x9cThe sector is suffering from a degree of over-boughtness and a touch of over-valuation\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the strategist. Overvaluation is easy enough to understand. Stocks are getting pricey. Over-boughtness happens when investors buy too much too fast which can lead to a sharp dip when buying dries up.GM stock for instance is up about 43% year to date far better than comparable returns of theS&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Average.That\xe2\x80\x99s a fast rise. Now the stock trades for about 11.5 times estimated 2021 earnings. That\xe2\x80\x99s not all that rich a valuation and a steep discount to the broader market\xe2\x80\x99s 23 times PE ratio. But traditional car maker stocks such as GM typically trade for less than 10 times earnings.That might be a problem but some of GM\xe2\x80\x99s improved valuation is coming from the reflection off a shinyTesla(TSLA) as investors are becoming convinced that smarter self-driving electric cars can benefit more than justElon Musk\xe2\x80\x98s company.Even though Darby is concerned he isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that negative. \xe2\x80\x9cSome care is warranted by becoming too bearish on the sector in the near-term\xe2\x80\x9d Darby added including in his report a quote from E.B. White summarizing the importance of cars. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything in life is somewhere else\xe2\x80\x9d White wrote \xe2\x80\x9cand you get there in a car.\xe2\x80\x9dInvestors should be watching used-car pricing but not overreacting yet. Near-term results for car-related companies should be solid helped by better industry pricing. The reaction to coming earnings reports and management comments on earnings conference calls will be the next chance for investors to see if inflation pricing is a boom or if the bubble will pop.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comCloseThe Used-Car Bubble: How Sky-High Pricing Is Good for Auto StocksThe used-car bubble is here.FromToMessageSENDAn error has occurred please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toPrivacy NoticeCookie NoticeCopyright PolicyData PolicyYour Ad ChoicesSubscriber Agreement & Terms of UseBarron's ArchiveCopyright \xc2\xa92021 Dow Jones & Company Inc.
