The company is involved in providing solutions to people who might be suffering from different kinds of visual impairments. That being said it seems that investors are still not yet convinced about the long-term prospects of the company. The stock has had a bit of a rollercoaster ride over the course of the past year.Related:\xc2\xa0 Acasti Pharma (ACST) has Hit a Bottom Bounces Back In SightAt some points the bulls have held sway while bears won the day at others. It was towards the end of 2020 that the stock really started showing signs of going on a strong rally after the bulls pushed it to $1.87 a share. Last month the stock enjoyed a remarkable rally and eventually hit its highest levels in 52 weeks of $20 a share. However the stock slumped to lower levels following a selloff.

b"Cyber-firm Darktrace eyes '\xc2\xa33bn' London share listing", b'2 days ago', b'Cyber-security firm Darktrace has said it intends to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Darktrace did not indicate how much it is seeking to raise but...Cyber-firm Darktrace eyes \'\xc2\xa33bn\' London share listing - BBC Newsimage copyrightGetty Imagesimage captionDarktrace\'s Poppy Gustafsson says her company is very different from DeliverooCyber-security firm Darktrace has said it intends to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange.Darktrace did not indicate how much it is seeking to raise but media reports suggest it could be as much as \xc2\xa33bn.The move is seen as a sign of confidence in the London market after Deliveroo\'s flop flotation last month.The food delivery business saw its shares fall sharply when trading began casting doubt on efforts to persuade more big tech firms to list in the UK.Darktrace was set up in 2013 by former members of the UK security services and maths professors.It was among the first companies in its field to use artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning to improve cyber-security.Rather than simply looking for a virus its systems constantly monitor a company\'s computer system to look for abnormal patterns or behaviours.Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debutDarktrace chief executive Poppy Gustafsson said a London listing was a "logical choice" for the Cambridge-based firm and that a US listing had not been considered.She said Darktrace was a "very different company" from Deliveroo being "a fundamental technology company".Darktrace\'s annual revenue has grown from $79.4m (\xc2\xa357.7m) to $199.1m in the past two years.However it did not turn a profit on a pre-tax or operating basis.Its largest shareholder is Invoke Trust an investment fund belonging to tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch who is facing fraud charges in the US related to the sale of his firm Autonomy in 2011 to computer giant Hewlett-Packard.Ms Gustafsson said Mr Lynch had no involvement in the day-to-day running of Darktrace and his legal proceedings would have no impact on its performance."There is a lot riding on Darktrace\'s forthcoming IPO after Deliveroo\'s stock market flop" said Russ Mould investment director at AJ Bell adding that the food delivery firm\'s "disaster" had "put a cloud over the UK tech sector and whether other tech entrepreneurs would really want to risk floating their company in London"."If Darktrace manages to float its shares successfully and see them rise in value once trading begins then sentiment may improve towards London as a listing venue" Mr Mould said.Related TopicsCyber-securityArtificial intelligenceCompaniesMore on this story\'It\'s a hacker\'s paradise out there\'Published30 April 2018Deliveroo shares tumble on stock market debutPublished31 MarchTop StoriesTories reject Labour plan for MP-led lobbying probeBoris Johnson says a government-commissioned review by a lawyer should examine the issue instead.Published5 minutes agoDUP leader Foster sues TV doctor for defamationPublished2 hours agoOffice manager begged terrorist not to stab herPublished4 minutes agoFeatures\'I\'m being used as a sex-baiting bot online\'Volcano blankets island in layer of grey.

He hopped on Twitter to discuss why he thinks ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) could be the next GameStop (NYSE:GME). The tweets have many investors sitting up in their seats. As one of the most shorted stocks Meade\xe2\x80\x99s case does hold water. And with retail investors chasing the success of GME through stocks like AMC (NYSE:AMC) there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of chatter around which stock could have the same squeeze potential as the video game retailer.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comWe can take a look at the most shorted stocks right now to see some potential short-squeeze candidates. One of these stocks is Second Sight Medical Products (NASDAQ:EYES). The eye health technology company has been called overvalued before after a regulatory approval sent EYES stock sky high. Now the company is short interest of 49.4%. While short-sellers predict EYES to drop off in value Second Sight has some real fans. And with news that the company has made two promising new additions to its board of directors sentiment could turn bullish.Another short squeeze candidate is\xc2\xa0Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK). With a 36.9% short interest many are predicting the company\xe2\x80\x99s failure. However it has a dedicated backing of retail fans including some r/WallStreetBets users. The company has actually seen some short squeeze activity in the last two days already providing 13% gains on Thursday.Most Shorted Stocks: Investors Search for Squeeze CandidatesDiscovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) is in a volatile state. The company was among those caught up in the Archegos Capital Management fallout. Now it seems investors are looking at DISCA stock for a short squeeze. It currently has 29.67% of its float sold short and as a player in the huge streaming industry there is consumer interest in what it offers.Finally\xc2\xa0Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ:CLVS) is a candidate for a GME-esque short squeeze. The oncology outfit has made promising news recently regarding its Rubraca trials. The company is hoping to get a product to market soon to help treat late-stage ovarian cancer patients and its clinical trials are suggesting the launch could be soon. Still CLVS stock is being bet against with 33.85% of its float shorted. With the positive news about the Rubraca tests as well as speculation of an acquisition in 2021 the stock seems like a prime candidate for a short squeeze.On the date of publication Brenden Rearick did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/most-shorted-stocks-could-eyes-blnk-disca-or-clvs-be-the-next-gamestop/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

Between a long unsuccessful campaign against\xc2\xa0Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) and numerous other troubled investments and Ackman\xe2\x80\x99s star had dimmed. Now though with a series of big wins including a home-run investment in Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) Ackman is back. He added another score to his ledger with the recent initial public offering (IPO) of Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock.Source: Ki young / Shutterstock.comAckman was an investor in Coupang from the very beginning. The site launched in 2010 and has transformed the South Korean e-commerce market with its laser focus on fast free delivery.It got its moment to shine during the pandemic with its sales growing nearly triple-digits year-over-year.Ackman took advantage of Coupang\xe2\x80\x99s rise to make a surprising move. Ackman decided to donate his entire CPNG stock stake which was 26.5 million shares of stock to charity. Although the breakdown wasn\xe2\x80\x99t made public his own foundation was among the charities. That is to say he believes in the stock enough to not completely abandon it.That\xe2\x80\x99s a more than $1 billion charitable gift at least based on Coupang\xe2\x80\x99s market price since it has started trading. So is Ackman cashing out at the top on Coupang? Not necessarily. In fact there is still reason to like CPNG stock going forward.Coupang: South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s E-Commerce GiantAs of 2020 Coupang has already become the largest e-commerce player in South Korea. That\xe2\x80\x99s a great place to be. South Korea is the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 12th largest globally. Additionally Coupang cites data that South Korea is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world.And as Coupang explains in its prospectus it has built an overwhelming infrastructure base in South Korea:\xe2\x80\x9c70% of the population lives within 7 miles of a Coupang logistics center. Our operational infrastructure spans over 25 million square feet across over 30 cities a footprint of over 400 football fields in a country that is 1% the size of the US geographically. Coupang has the largest [business-to-consumer] logistics footprint as compared to other product e-commerce players in Korea.\xe2\x80\x9dThis is an interesting and laudable approach. In many countries we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen e-commerce companies expand quickly but with limited capital investment. This leaves the market vulnerable to newer players.Witness\xc2\xa0Sea\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE:SE) Shopee platform which is overtaking MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) in some South American markets despite MercadoLibre having a decade-long first-mover advantage. But MercadoLibre never established an unassailable logistics advantage leaving it vulnerable to more nimble entrants.Coupang by contrast is seeking to ensure that it will dominate South Korea and not let any rivals disrupt its position. To that point Coupang is already the third-largest employer in all of South Korea.Some investors might prefer a broader focus however having a huge market share in one key market may be preferable to being a struggling number-two or -three player in a larger number of countries.Coupang\xe2\x80\x99s RisksValuation is a major concern for CPNG stock here. The stock is going for nearly 7x price/sales which is awfully steep for a pure online retailer.You can make a case for higher price/sales ratios on companies such as\xc2\xa0Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have extensive businesses in addition to retail. However 7x for Coupang seems rich in a world where other e-commerce leaders like China\xe2\x80\x99s JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) trade for just 1-2x sales.Another big concern with Coupang is that it primarily services just South Korea. South Korea is a relatively small country and has an essentially flat population growth rate. This means that the market likely won\xe2\x80\x99t grow much over time. \xe2\x80\x98Coupang already serves nearly 30% of South Korean consumers as is so the total addressable market isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily all that large at least not without international expansion.Finally it\xe2\x80\x99s worth considering that tensions periodically flare between North and South Korea and this often causes sharp corrections in the South Korean market. This could hit CPNG stock at some point.CPNG Stock VerdictBill Ackman is good at picking winners and it looks as if he chose another good one in Coupang. In just 11 years Coupang went from a start-up to a market leader in its country.The question now is one of valuation. Skeptics can point to Ackman\xe2\x80\x99s donation as a sign that CPNG stock has become overvalued in the short run. This is a reasonable viewpoint at the present time.Over the long term however there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that Coupang will continue to grow quickly and reward its shareholders. Coupang\xe2\x80\x99s focus on South Korea appears to have set it up as one of e-commerce\xe2\x80\x99s long-term favorites.On the date of publication Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

I think if you ask occupiers today what that means for their future requirements there will be some loss of office space within occupiers\' portfolios but nowhere near the degree that some had feared probably about a year ago and there are a number of reasons for that" he said."I think mental health is an obvious one. We have all been stuck in our little rooms or home offices for 12 months without any form of day-to-day contact and that has really harmed people\'s mental health."I do not think we are going to see the levels [of office occupancy] we saw pre-Covid; what it will mean is that there will be a flight to quality. Gone are the days of the offices just full of desks."PITCH holds 32.9% of its portfolio in offices according to its Q4 2020 factsheet and Martindale said this leans towards well-connected city centre buildings with good amenities.12TweetFacebookLinkedInShare on WhatsappSend toTopicsInvestment TrustsFundsESGSimon MartindaleProperty Income Trust for CharitiesPITCHSustainable investmentsustainable investingethical investmentethical investingResponsible Investmentresponsible investingresponsible capitalismESGsectorstrendsresidential propertyMayfair CapitalConsistent 50: Ten new entrants as Meridian European Smaller Companies tightens grip at topEvenlode to launch global equity fund under Elliott and KnoedlerLiontrust\'s Michaelis: Our sustainable investing should never be mainstreamPlugging the leaks: Can funds improve investor outcomes by rethinking administration costs?US Solar Fund trust targets $105m secondary fundraise to target acquisitions and finance debtColumbia Threadneedle to assume BMO EMEA asset management businessMark Barnett to join Tellworth to launch UK equity income fundJonathan Golan joins Man GLG as portfolio managerMark Harries joins Square Mile as CIO as Broomer steps downNomura adds RBC\'s Robinson to Hodges\' unconstrained fixed income teamPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.blog comments powered by DisqusBack to TopTrustpilotContact usMarketing solutionsAbout Incisive MediaTerms and conditionsPoliciesCareersTwitterLinkedInNewslettersFacebookYouTubeInstagram\xc2\xa9 Incisive Business Media (IP) Limited Published by Incisive Business Media Limited New London House 172 Drury Lane London WC2B 5QR registered in England and Wales with company registration numbers 09177174 & 09178013Digital publisher of the yearDigital publisher of the year 2010 2013 2016 & 2017', b'https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/analysis/4029606/long-term-view-pitch-eyes-residential-housing-potential-income-opportunity'
