Companies that have been...Is Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) Popular Amongst Institutions? - Simply Wall St News The big shareholder groups in Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) have power over the company.Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.Green Plains has a market capitalization of US$1.2b so we would expect some institutional investors to have noticed the stock.Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems thatinstitutions are noticeable on the share registry.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Green Plains.See our latest analysis for Green Plains NasdaqGS:GPRE Ownership Breakdown April 11th 2021 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Green Plains? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Green Plains already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company.This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too get it wrong sometimes.If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Green Plains' earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters. NasdaqGS:GPRE Earnings and Revenue Growth April 11th 2021Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.Green Plains is not owned by hedge funds.BlackRock Inc. is currently the largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding.With 6.2% and 5.6% of the shares outstanding respectively The Vanguard Group Inc. and Dimensional Fund Advisors L.P. are the second and third largest shareholders.Furthermore CEO Todd Becker is the owner of 1.4% of the company's shares.Looking at the shareholder registry we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Green Plains The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least.The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.I can report that insiders do own shares in Green Plains Inc..It is a pretty big company so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case they own around US$60m worth of shares (at current prices).Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.General Public Ownership The general public holds a 13% stake in Green Plains.While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Green Plains better we need to consider many other factors.Take risks for example - Green Plains has4 warning signs(and 2 which are potentially serious)we think you should know about.But ultimatelyit is the future not the past that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Often when a stock trades for under $10 (also termed a penny stock) it is trading that low for a reason. The company may not be profitable or in the case of GameStop it finds itself with a business model that no longer fits with consumer trends.But that\xe2\x80\x99s not always the case. It is possible to find low-priced stocks even penny stocks that offer great value. This is particularly true if the stock offers investors a dividend. Dividend-earning stocks are a diversification source for a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio particularly if the dividend gets reinvested. It\xe2\x80\x99s literally like paying yourself for owning the stock.And the stocks in this presentation look ready also to deliver some additional stock price growth that can increase your total return.View the "7 Low-Priced Dividend Stocks Under $10".Free Email NewsletterComplete the form below to receive the latest headlines and analysts\' recommendations for your stocks with our free daily email newsletter:Email AddressMost Read This Week3 Stocks Near 52-Week Lows Ready to Buy3 Growth Stocks Displaying Market Leadership3 Stocks with Bullish Insider ActivityViacom Stock is a Bargain Pullback Opportunity Here3 Capital Markets Stocks to Buy Now3 Sectors To Buy When The Market Pulls Back\xc2\xa0Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) IPO: 3 Things for Investors to KnowArtificial Intelligence Revolution: 3 Stocks to Automate Your GainsSemiconductor Industry Set To Benefit From Global Chip ShortageSleeping Giant Cisco Stock is Reawakening For a Huge Breakout Recent ArticlesInsteel Industries Stock is a U.S. Infrastructure Pure PlayNXP Semiconductors Looks to Carry Momentum into 20213 Dividend Stocks to Help You Fight Inflation3 Online Payment Stocks Capitalizing On Covid-Era Trends3 Consumer Defensive Stocks Delivering Tech-Like ReturnsDiscovery Networks Stock is a Becoming a Pullback Opportunity Lower3 High Margin Companies Worth BuyingThe Lovesac Hyper-Growth Story Hits New High\xc2\xa0Bed Bath & Beyond Looks Beyond its Meme Stock DaysJPMorgan Flat After Blow-Out QuarterSearch Headlines:Search ArticlesMarketBeat Minute PodcastEach market day you\'ll get a one-minute market summary to help you invest wisely.Subscribe to MarketBeat Minute30 Days of MarketBeat All Access for $1.00Sign up for MarketBeat All Access to gain access to MarketBeat\'s full suite of research tools:Best-in-Class Portfolio MonitoringView the latest news buy/sell ratings SEC filings and insider transactions for your stocks.

If you mix in a short squeeze the potential short-term gains in a low float stock can be extreme.A stock's float is the number of shares that trade freely on the public market. Because insiders and institutional investors don\xe2\x80\x99t typically trade their shares on a daily basis those shares don\xe2\x80\x99t typically contribute to a stock's near-term liquidity. Float is the number of shares that remain after accounting for insider and institutional ownership.Why Is It Important? When a stock gains positive momentum in the market momentum buyers can rush in all at once. If a stock has a high short interest short covering can quickly ramp up demand for shares triggering a short squeeze. Since low float stocks have relatively few shares trading freely a major imbalance in supply and demand can serve as rocket fuel for share price.Buying a low float stock with high short interest isn\xe2\x80\x99t a guarantee of a short squeeze. There still typically needs to be some form of catalyst to get the stock moving in the first place. However traders can keep an eye on these stocks for any signs of life to try to catch most of a potential big move.Related Link: 3 Short Squeeze Candidates In The Industrial SectorShort Squeeze Candidates: Here are three materials sector stocks that have all the ingredients for a short squeeze.Green Plains Inc (NASDAQ:GPRE)Green Plains produces fuel-grade ethanol and corn oil. The stock is already up 115% year-to-date so far in 2021 demonstrating its potential for volatility. Green Plains has reported negative revenue growth in each of the past four years but as many meme stock traders have realized in 2021 short squeezes are technical market phenomena and don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have anything to do with the company\xe2\x80\x99s underlying business fundamentals or the stock\xe2\x80\x99s long-term outlook.Green Plains\xe2\x80\x99 float isn\xe2\x80\x99t minuscule but it's relatively small at around 33.7 million. However 24.9% of its float is currently held short suggesting a lot of short sellers are already feeling the heat from the 2021 rally and the potential short squeeze could be just getting startedIT Tech Packaging Inc (NYSE:ITP)IT Tech Packaging is a Chinese company that produces paper products such as printing paper corrugating medium paper and digital photo paper. The stock\xe2\x80\x99s 23.1 million-share float and its short percent of float of 21% are the perfect ingredients for a potential short squeeze.In addition short squeeze traders have frequently targeted stocks trading under $5 per share this year and IT Tech shares currently trade at just 66 cents. Finally the stock has repeatedly demonstrated its potential volatility spiking from around 50 cents to as high as $1.39 back in October and from under 80 cents to $1.45 in February.Westwater Resources Inc (NYSE:WWR)Westwater Resources is a mineral resources explorer and developer focused on the battery graphite business in the state of Alabama.Westwater\xe2\x80\x99s 17.4% short percent of float isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as high as the other two materials stocks but its 32.3 million-share float still provides an opportunity for a potential squeeze. Westwater also has a history of extreme volatility. In September 2020 the stock spiked from under $1.50 to as high as $14.50 in about two weeks.\xc2\xa9 2020 Benzinga.com.
