Shares are up 180% this year. At one point MVIS stock was up 355%. However this pure play on LiDAR technology looks to have some short-term concerns. And maybe some long-term ones as well.Source: Olivier Le Moal / Shutterstock.comWhat if I were to tell you that the company\xe2\x80\x99s revenue has been steadily declining since 2016? And what if I went further and said that prior to 2020 the company was a legitimate penny stock for much of that time? Finally what if I also mentioned the company has been in business for 28 years and is still not profitable?Apparently none of those things matter to the investor who has belief. In this case retail investors are hyped about the company\xe2\x80\x99s push to become a significant player in the automotive safety market.LiDAR will be an essential component of autonomous vehicle technology but while the technology may be a reality an autonomous future looks years away.Objects Are Further Away Than They Appear for MVIS StockI apologize for the cheesy turn of a phrase but much of the hype around MVIS stock revolves around the company\xe2\x80\x99s development of a LiDAR sensor (LRL sensor). These sensors will be essential for the development of Level 4 or Level 5 autonomous vehicles and many investors are excited about this promising future.Only the most bullish investor believes this future will be available in the next few years. Many industry observers think 2030 is a more realistic goal\xc2\xa0and it most likely will be further away than that.In the years prior to the pandemic many developers scaled back on their autonomous development. Those that continue with development plans remain noncommittal on when anything can be rolled out.You Have to Be Right Every TimeOne of my concerns regarding a stock like Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is liability. Sending civilian humans into suborbital space and back to a safe landing is not without risk.They simply have to be right every time. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the company won\xe2\x80\x99t be successful but it does mean that any timeframe is likely to be expanded.The same seems true with autonomous vehicles. For example Uber (NYSE:UBER) suspended its testing program despite many autonomous miles logged due to the unfortunate death of a pedestrian in 2018.None of this is Microvision\xe2\x80\x99s fault but if an autonomous future is indeed years away from becoming a reality it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to ask MVIS stock investors to exercise caution.Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the competition of which there is quite a bit. Right now LiDAR companies are picking up where electric vehicle companies left off and as with the EV sector there seems to be a shiny object syndrome that\xe2\x80\x99s creeping in.Sure there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be room for more than one company but there are other companies that simply appear to be better investments in the sector.The Payoff for MVIS Stock is Years AwayThere are times when one of the InvestorPlace writers says it far better than I can. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll give a cap tip to Joanna Makris who recently wrote this statement that should engender skepticism about MVIS stock.\xe2\x80\x9cToday even though Micro is a 28-year old company boasting a portfolio of over 500 patents it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t converted any of this IP into licensing revenue\xe2\x80\x9d Makris wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cNor has it been able to land a direct purchase from a technology or industrial company.\xe2\x80\x9dMicrovision does business in other sectors including home security and IoT products. However it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear that those businesses are causing excitement among investors. In 2020 the company\xe2\x80\x99s revenue was 65% lower on a year-over-year basis.That puts an asterisk in front of the company\xe2\x80\x99s improved earnings. In 2020 the company reported negative earnings per share of nine cents which was significantly better than the negative earnings of 24 cents reported the prior year.But to put all of that into perspective MVIS stock was trading well below $1 for most of 2019. Institutional investors are staying far away from the stock and short interest sits around 15%.The bullish case for Microvision is going to depend in large part on how quickly the market for autonomous vehicles becomes a reality but that\xe2\x80\x99s not a future that the company can speak into existence. Without that revenue MVIS stock looks very overvalued.On the date of publication Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for seven years.

The question now is whether MVIS stock is worth the gamble at the present juncture.Source:MicrovisionOn one hand I can understand the enthusiasm. As a specialist in lidar (light detection and ranging) Microvision presents an intriguingly bullish case so long as the company is successful in delivering a viable product. With multiple automakers and technology firms pushing into both electric vehicles and autonomous driving solutions MVIS stock could soar if the underlying company manages to secure a deal with one of these players.Generally speaking automakers have been optimistic about the acceleration of autonomous technologies. Many anticipate that within a few short years we\xe2\x80\x99ll see some level of autonomous driving hitting the road. Again this benefits the narrative for MVIS stock as it implies that more companies are willing to entertain lidar-based partnerships to get a leg up on the competition.Reasons to Be Skeptical of MVIS StockStill skepticism toward MVIS stock remains. For one thing I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of too many people that are excited about betting on more upside from an equity unit that has already skyrocketed over 6000%. Further as my InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth pointed out Microvision shares traded at 790-times sales when he wrote his article.As of now that metric has gone down but Ashworth\xe2\x80\x99s point still stands.Both he and InvestorPlace market analyst Joanna Makris make the point that competition is stiff with Makris stating:\xe2\x80\x9cAlso in the market are more focused and vertically integrated automotive technology companies. This includes companies like Veoneer (NYSE:VNE) Aptiv Plc (NYSE:APTV) Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) and Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR). All of these competitors have closer ties to automakers than Microvision.\xe2\x80\x9dFundamentally you\xe2\x80\x99d figure that Microvision has a greater risk of fading away than being one of the top lidar players. Further Makris points out that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Microvision claimed to have a game-changing technology. Its PicoP laser sensing and scanning engine promised to revolutionize cell phones but ended up being a dud.Lidar Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Without Its Question MarksStill you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give credit where it\xe2\x80\x99s due. As Ashworth remarked many pharmaceutical and biotech names pivoted to the Covid-19 treatment/vaccination race because that\xe2\x80\x99s where the money was. Invariably though the biggest winners thus far in that space have been the usual suspects \xe2\x80\x93 essentially big pharma.Therefore a chance exists that MVIS stock could grow into its valuation. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a far off one personally. But the market wants lidar and other autonomous driving solutions so management is playing the best card it has.Still the other risk for MVIS stock is the one that impacts every other lidar/autonomous driving investment: is the underlying industry truly a viable one?According to PCmag.com contributor Ben Dickson we\xe2\x80\x99re far away from Level 5 autonomy which is completely autonomous driving in all conditions. Key to this assessment is that artificial intelligence lacks common sense. In order to acquire that it needs massive amounts of data to enhance its deep learning capabilities. As Dickson stated:\xe2\x80\x9cHuman drivers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know everything to make reasonable decisions when facing new situations \xe2\x80\xa6 but current AI systems lack common sense intuitive physics basic psychology and other elements that make us humans general problem solvers.\xe2\x80\x9dIn other words the visualization challenge for lidar systems is just the beginning. The comprehensive AI component is what will make or break a lidar company.In Over Its HeadGoing back to Makris\xe2\x80\x99 point most lidar companies engaged in autonomous driving are laser focused on their core business. That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the case with Microvision which is an intelligent sensory firm. Some might argue that the company is throwing darts and seeing which one sticks.Ultimately though the main challenge with MVIS stock is that the underlying tech firm is competing in a scientifically and capital-intensive business. However Microvision is already priced beyond perfection five times over. Chances are you\xe2\x80\x99d do well to avoid it at this price.On the date of publication Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
