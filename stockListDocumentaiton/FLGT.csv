Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Red GoboWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdSeniors Are Getting Walk-In Tubs At A FractionSearch Walk-in Tubs BenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2NeckRelaxWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdSkip The Chiropractor & Reduce Neck& Shoulder PainThanks to its compact and ingenious design I can use the NeckRelax practically anywhere. ReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d agoBloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2History A2ZWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdEpic Clothing Fails That Are Too Good To Be TrueHard to believe these clothing fails actually exist CoinDeskBitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in SiberiaMining company BitRiver is launching its own token aiming to raise $35 million on Bithumb2d agoReutersBitcoin hits record before landmark Coinbase listing on NasdaqLONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a record of $62741 on Tuesday extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day before the listing of Coinbase shares in the United States.The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange\'s listing on the Nasdaq on Wednesday is considered a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates.Bitcoin is the world\'s biggest cryptocurrency with growing mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment.1d agoBloombergFirst Bitcoin ETF in North America Hits $1 Billion in Assets(Bloomberg) -- Less than two months after launching the first North American Bitcoin ETF already reached $1 billion (C$1.25 billion) in assets according to a statement from its issuer.

In a commentary dated Monday Ling Huawei managing editor of Caixin Media and Caixin Weekly discussed the possibility of a China Huarong bankruptcy.The firm\xe2\x80\x99s dollar bonds edged up from session lows after Bloomberg reported China\xe2\x80\x99s finance ministry is mulling transferring its stake in China Huarong to a unit of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign wealth fund that invests in financial companies. Some notes rose as much as 2 cents though are still set for record closing lows.Moody\xe2\x80\x99s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings said Tuesday they will review their ratings of China Huarong for a potential downgrade following a similar announcement from rival S&P Global Ratings last week. The company is considered an investment-grade issuer by all three agencies.The selloff spread to other high-yield Chinese dollar notes on Tuesday with some property bonds falling by a record. Asia\xe2\x80\x99s investment-grade dollar debt spreads widened as much as 3 basis points while a gauge of Asia credit risk widened for a seventh straight day set for the longest rising streak since 2018.Chinese investment-grade dollar bond spreads widened by as much as 8 basis points while prices on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s high-yield notes fell as much as 3 cents on the dollar according to credit traders. The CSI 300 Index of stocks fell 0.2%.\xe2\x80\x9cHuarong is a $22 billion curve and as a distressed situation it dwarfs anything that we have seen in the Asia credit market before\xe2\x80\x9d said Owen Gallimore head of trading strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fatal event for a few trading desks and small funds.\xe2\x80\x9dBonds linked to the company have plunged this month after China Huarong failed to publish its 2020 preliminary results by the March 31 deadline with Caixin attributing the delay to plans for a significant financial restructuring. The stock has been suspended in Hong Kong since April 1. The company has until the end of the month to release its final earnings report. China Huarong\xe2\x80\x99s biggest shareholder is the country\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Finance.\xe2\x80\x9cMarket speculation of a restructuring with haircuts for Huarong International bondholders is heavily damaging investor sentiment\xe2\x80\x9d said Chang Wei Liang a macro strategist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore. \xe2\x80\x9cThe continued silence of Chinese authorities on the predicament of a strategic state-owned institution as large as Huarong is also worrisome as investors had anticipated at least a modicum of reassurance.\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether Chinese leaders have discussed the fate of China Huarong\xe2\x80\x99s bondholders or outlined specific measures that the fund would take if it assumes control of the China Huarong stake.China Huarong has been under a shadow since its then-chairman Lai Xiaomin came under investigation in 2018. Under his watch the company expanded into areas including securities trading trusts and other investments deviating from the original mandate of disposing bad debt. Lai was put to death earlier this year for bribery after a brief trial an unusually harsh sentence for such a crime.The company is one of the four state-owned entities set up by China\xe2\x80\x99s government in 1999 to help clean up a banking system riddled with bad debt. It listed in Hong Kong after a $2.5 billion initial public offering in 2015.China Huarong and its subsidiaries have some $42 billion worth of offshore and local bonds outstanding and 41% of that will come due by the end of next year according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Dollar bonds make up about $22 billion of its outstanding notes.Because the debt load is so large and the company was previously seen as a safe bet the securities are widely held by both local and international investors. Institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. previously disclosed they held Huarong bonds had exposure to them via fund products or both according to data compiled by Bloomberg.China Huarong has started trimming non-core assets amid regulatory pressure to return to its roots. Net income slumped 92% in the first half of 2020 from a year earlier as the value of some assets dropped in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company\xe2\x80\x99s stock market value has tumbled to about $5 billion from $15 billion when it listed.For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.1d agoReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamLONDON (Reuters) -Coinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.9h agoMore Stories', b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fulgent-genetic-flgt-stock-sinks-214509843.html'

Last week it closed at more than $85. If you were to invest $10000 in the business a year ago you would be sitting on a gain of about $75000 right now. That\'s an exceptional return in a fairly short time frame.But what is behind Fulgent\'s rapid ascent and can the stock continue rising?Fulgent has been a key provider of COVID-19 testing services and that has given the company\'s numbers a considerable boost. When it last reported its quarterly results on March 4 its sales of $295 million were up a staggering 3400% year over year. It delivered 3.2 million tests which was 230 times last year\'s Q4 number. And for 2021 it is still expecting its sales to grow at a rate of 90% with its top line climbing to $800 million. In 2019 Fulgent\'s sales totaled just $33 million. The company remains optimistic about the future with CEO Ming Hsieh stating that "I believe we are extremely well positioned in the years ahead as vaccine rollout continues and our lives return to a state of normalcy."Fulgent also generated 43% year-over-year growth in testing this past quarter that didn\'t involve COVID-19. The company is growing at a phenomenal rate and the big question is what it will look like after concerns surrounding the pandemic subside. However it may be a while before that happens. And that means that in the meantime Fulgent could continue to be a hot growth stock to buy. Despite the impressive gains it has generated thus far it may not be too late to invest in the company.Stocks to WatchReverse Triangular Merger Creates Largest Publicly Traded Ethereum Mining CompanyGoldman Sachs Hikes on Q1 FiguresGalectin Gains on Product NewsWFC Eases on Q1 NumbersBed Bath & Beyond Takes Bath in SalesPrevious ArticlesSubscribe to Get Small Cap News & Alerts!About UsContact UsAdvertiseLicense Our ContentJobsDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyCopyright 1998 - 2021 Baystreet.ca Media Corp.

Flores\' father Ruben Ricardo Flores 80 was also arrested on Tuesday and accused of helping his son dispose of Smart\'s remains. Smart a freshman at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo disappeared in May 1996 after attending a party. Witnesses said Paul Flores said he would make sure she made it safely back to her dorm but Smart was never seen again. Classmates described Flores as awkward and unpopular the Los Angeles Times reports and during questioning from authorities he admitted to lying about how he got a black eye. Investigators used search dogs and radar equipment to try to find Smart\'s body but her remains have never been discovered. She was declared dead in 2002. San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson told reporters on Tuesday that new evidence in the case was secured in 2016 and in 2019 after hearing a podcast about the Smart case witnesses came forward and were interviewed for the first time by authorities. Search warrants were issued for the home of Flores his father his mother and his sister and during a second search of Flores\' home physical evidence "related to the murder of Kristin Smart" was found Parkinson said. An attorney for Paul Flores declined to comment while an attorney for Ruben Flores told the Times his client is "absolutely innocent." Parkinson said police will continue to look for Smart\'s remains and in a statement her family said they hope the arrests of Paul and Ruben Flores will be "the first step to bringing our daughter home."
