As a SPAC\xc2\xa0Soaring Eagle\xc2\xa0has\xc2\xa0raised more than\xc2\xa0$1 billion.The SPAC comes from Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan who are the team behind taking Draftkings Inc (NASDAQ: DKNG) and Skillz Inc (NYSE: SKLZ) public. \xe2\x80\x9cThe group is only at NAV\xe2\x80\x9d Spac Guru said.Spac Guru told viewers\xc2\xa0this could be a great SPAC to look at if you \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t know where to go\xe2\x80\x9d given the track record of Sloan and Sagansky.Bull Horn Holdings Corp (NASDAQ: BHSE): Spac Guru\xe2\x80\x99s dark horse candidate for an undervalued SPAC is Bull Horn Holdings.\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason that I like Bull Horn is first of all Rob Striar is a stud\xe2\x80\x9d Spac Guru said of the leader of the SPAC. Spac Guru cited Striar\'s\xc2\xa0experience with Walt Disney Co\xc2\xa0(NYSE: DIS) and several professional sports companies.The Bull Horn Holdings SPAC also downsized its amount raised when it went public with Striar saying\xc2\xa0this was \xe2\x80\x9ca competitive advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d Spac Guru pointed out that the lower sponsorship fees from Bull Horn could help the SPAC be attractive to companies looking to go public.Bull Horn has \xe2\x80\x9cbetter terms for a company that goes public.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more on Bull Horn check out Benzinga\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Rob Striar here.Related Link: 6 Sports SPACs To Consider For Your Investing PlayboyOmnichannel Acquisition Corp (NYSE: OCA): Another SPAC highlighted by Spac Guru was Omnichannel Acquisition.\xe2\x80\x9cAnother one that I really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is OCA\xe2\x80\x9d SpacGuru said highlighting the stock trading below $10.Spac Guru highlighted Gary Vaynerchuk who is a member of the SPAC leadership team. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guy is a stud" SpacGuru\xc2\xa0said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guy is 100% always on and he will die before he quits.\xe2\x80\x9dSpac Guru told viewers to look at the management team for the SPAC: \xe2\x80\x9cI like to bet the jockey not the horse.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more on Omnichannel Acquisition check out Benzinga\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Matt Higgins here.Other Picks: Along with the three undervalued SPACs Spac Guru highlighted he\xc2\xa0also shared his thoughts on Supernova Partners Acquisition Co Inc\xc2\xa0(NYSE: SPNV) calling its co-founder Spencer Rascoff a stud. This SPAC\xc2\xa0is taking Offerpad public.Spac Guru also mentioned that he has been adding to his positions in Arrival Group SA\xc2\xa0(NASDAQ: ARVL) and ArcLight Clean Transition Corp (NASDAQ: ACTC) which is bringing Proterra public.Disclosure: The author is long shares of SRNGU and OCA.

New issues actually traded up (unlike the tail end of March) and several deals were met with investor enthusiasm. Highlights include:Rice Acquisition RICE soaring day-1 +52% on its announcement of Aria/ArchaeaMudrick Capital (MUDS) with a nice Day-1 pop in taking Topps publicA few other deals including TWCT and ROT were not met with much enthusiasm from the market. That being said it\'s good to see deal activity come back. There are several rumored large transactions that could be coming any day now:Grab the Singaporean app for everything and Altimeter Growth (AGC).

\xe2\x80\x93 Boardroom Alpha2.1kSHARES3.8kVIEWSShare Share Share ShareADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTIPOB Stock \xe2\x80\x93 SPAC Opportunities for Monday \xe2\x80\x93 Boardroom AlphaLast week we saw further evidence that the SPAC market has come back onto firm footing after the quick and painful fall from \xe2\x80\x9cpeak SPAC\xe2\x80\x9d in February. The play for many continues to be a patient yield + optionality one. They will be looking for pre-deal SPACs at a discount (or close) or SPACs with an announced deal that remain within range of NAV that they think could see a pop on great execution news.Our sense is that IPOs will mostly continue to trade close to NAV early meaning fewer fast money hedge fund flipping. But in instances where there is a strong track record (e.g. Keith Meister / Casdin\xe2\x80\x99s CM Life SPACs) you\xe2\x80\x99ll see good interest.Two of the big macro narratives that could drive SPAC success continue to be Biden\xe2\x80\x98s infrastructure bill and climate change which drives environmental / sustainability / EV / decarbonization plays. Though one wonders if the latter will still suffer from the glut of pre-revenue highly speculative plays that have already been made and a growing track record of red flags (e.g. NKLA ACIC RMO) that may have investors spooked.On RMO as we noted last week the SEC is taking a closer look at SPACs and everyone in that ecosystem should be aware that making big financial projections at deal announcement and then missing them significantly will draw real scrutiny. In particular investors should be looking at the additional deals the sponsor (the RMG team as a total of 8 with many pre-IPO) has in the pipeline with particularly clear eyes.Rumored SPAC deals include:Grab the Singaporean app for everything and Altimeter Growth (AGC). Which is being billed as potentially the largest ever SPAC M&A transactionSoaring Eagle (SRNG) is exploring a $20bn+ deal with Ginkgo BioworksBridgetown (BTWN) and Traveloka the Indonesian travel co.Yucaipa Acquisition Corp (YAC) and Signa SportsIsrael-based automotive chip company Valens Semiconductor Ltd. is rumored but no details on which SPAC is involved.Buy the Dip?

Holdings II (IPOB) Stock price2.1kSHARES3.8kVIEWSShare Share Share ShareADVERTISEMENTIPOB Stock \xe2\x80\x93 Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings II (IPOB) Stock priceLast week we saw further evidence that the SPAC market has come back onto firm footing after the quick and painful fall from \xe2\x80\x9cpeak SPAC\xe2\x80\x9d in February. The play for many continues to be a patient yield + optionality one. They will be looking for pre-deal SPACs at a discount (or close) or SPACs with an announced deal that remain within range of NAV that they think could see a pop on great execution news.Our sense is that IPOs will mostly continue to trade close to NAV early meaning fewer fast money hedge fund flipping. But in instances where there is a strong track record (e.g. Keith Meister / Casdin\xe2\x80\x99s CM Life SPACs) you\xe2\x80\x99ll see good interest.Two of the big macro narratives that could drive SPAC success continue to be Biden\xe2\x80\x98s infrastructure bill and climate change which drives environmental / sustainability / EV / decarbonization plays. Though one wonders if the latter will still suffer from the glut of pre-revenue highly speculative plays that have already been made and a growing track record of red flags (e.g. NKLA ACIC RMO) that may have investors spooked.On RMO as we noted last week the SEC is taking a closer look at SPACs and everyone in that ecosystem should be aware that making big financial projections at deal announcement and then missing them significantly will draw real scrutiny. In particular investors should be looking at the additional deals the sponsor (the RMG team as a total of 8 with many pre-IPO) has in the pipeline with particularly clear eyes.Rumored SPAC deals include:Grab the Singaporean app for everything and Altimeter Growth (AGC). Which is being billed as potentially the largest ever SPAC M&A transactionSoaring Eagle (SRNG) is exploring a $20bn+ deal with Ginkgo BioworksBridgetown (BTWN) and Traveloka the Indonesian travel co.Yucaipa Acquisition Corp (YAC) and Signa SportsIsrael-based automotive chip company Valens Semiconductor Ltd. is rumored but no details on which SPAC is involved.Buy the Dip?

The play for many continues to be a patient yield + optionality one. They will be looking for pre-deal SPACs at a discount (or close) or SPACs with an announced deal that remain within range of NAV that they think could see a pop on great execution news.\xc2\xa0Our sense is that IPOs will mostly continue to trade close to NAV early meaning fewer fast money hedge fund flipping. But in instances where there is a strong track record (e.g. Keith Meister / Casdin\'s CM Life SPACs) you\'ll see good interest.Two of the big macro narratives that could drive SPAC success continue to be Biden\'s infrastructure bill and climate change which drives environmental / sustainability / EV / decarbonization plays. Though one wonders if the latter will still suffer from the glut of pre-revenue highly speculative plays that have already been made and a growing track record of red flags (e.g. NKLA ACIC RMO) that may have investors spooked.On RMO as we noted last week the SEC is taking a closer look at SPACs and everyone in that ecosystem should be aware that making big financial projections at deal announcement and then missing them significantly will draw real scrutiny. In particular investors should be looking at the additional deals the sponsor (the RMG team as a total of 8 with many pre-IPO) has in the pipeline with particularly clear eyes.Rumored SPAC deals include:Grab the Singaporean app for everything and Altimeter Growth (AGC). Which is being billed as potentially the largest ever SPAC M&A transactionSoaring Eagle (SRNG) is exploring a $20bn+ deal with Ginkgo BioworksBridgetown (BTWN) and Traveloka the Indonesian travel co.Yucaipa Acquisition Corp (YAC) and Signa SportsIsrael-based automotive chip company Valens Semiconductor Ltd. is rumored but no details on which SPAC is involved.Buy the Dip?
