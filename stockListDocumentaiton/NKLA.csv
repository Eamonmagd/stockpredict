Matt specializes in writing about bank stocks REITs and personal finance but he loves any investment at the right price. Follow him on Twitter to keep up with his latest work!Follow @TMFMathGuyThe Motley Fool\'s chief growth officer Anand Chokkavelu and Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP recently ranked 11 of the most popular "meme stocks" and to the surprise of many it wasn\'t GameStop (NYSE:GME) or AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) at the bottom of the list. Find out which stock was their least favorite meme stock in this\xc2\xa0Fool Live video clip\xc2\xa0recorded on June 25.Matt Frankel: So Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) I\'m going to give a few stats about each of these that are pretty common. All of these have pretty high short interest with a couple of exceptions. Nikola\'s is one of the highest they\'ve 32% of their float is sold short right now. That just generally one of the big telling signs of a meme stock in general before we really get into it.Anand Chokkavelu: 32 is big. Anything over 5% right is pretty-Frankel: I think the S&P average is right around 3%. The whole initial premise with the meme stocks with WallStreetBets was that so many short-sellers were betting against GameStop. They created a lot of hype on the Reddit boards and sent a bunch of new money flowing in and it set off this chain reaction where shorts were forced to cover. That was the GameStop initial thing but then it trickled down to all these other heavily shorted stocks. Nikola has a market cap of about little over $7 billion right now. The stock is up about 20% year to date which doesn\'t really sound like a meme stock. When I get to AMC\'s return that\'s going to seem like nothing. But it has been a very wild ride. Nikola trades for about $18 a share as I write this a little bit more than that its peak is almost $75 a share. Nikola has been kind of a scandal-plagued company. If you want to go back and listen to our EV show you\'ll hear about some of the scandals so I\'m not going to get too much onto that. But they focus on developing battery electric vehicles fuel cell hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles with a particular focus on trucks. There\'s some impressive partnerships. TravelCenters of America had them install a couple of hydrogen fuel stations. My biggest concern with Nikola and I think it was Jason who covered this on the first show so unfortunately he\'s not here. But one of his major problems is that not only was it very scandal plagued this is a very competitive space and this is a pre-revenue company and it\'s really tough to identify the competitive advantages over some of the incumbents. GM\xc2\xa0and Ford\xc2\xa0could easily use some of their $30 billion or whatever of EV spending in the truck market to build that up. GM was partnering with Nikola somewhat for a little while but they backed away after all the scandals came out. Proterra is a company that we talked about on The Rank a few weeks ago that is developing really impressive technology for commercial vehicles and could potentially steal some thunder from a company like Nikola. Then you have the big EV leaders like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Tesla\'s been interested in getting into the truck market for years so it\'s really tough to identify their competitive advantage. Big short interest and with all the kind of short-seller attacks and scandals we\'ve seen in the stock it\'s really not surprising that it\'s 80% off the highs right now. This was my No. 11.

"Following" : "Follow"}}July 06 2021 8:30am608CommentsShare:Canadian-based tonneau provider Worksport (OTC: WKSP) has heated up the solar landscape.The company\xe2\x80\x99s high quality modular and attractively priced tonneau covers and solar-powered systems for light-duty trucks like Ford (NYSE: F) GM (NYSE: GM) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) have been performing well in sales.By the end of 2021 its allied TerraVis COR\xe2\x84\xa2 mobile energy storage system (ESS) will be another redefining product targeted for vacationers second-home owners and campers.But the company\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting revelation thus far arguably has been the potential uplisting to the Nasdaq stock exchange.What are the Benefits of Uplisting?Uplisting is the practice of elevating a company from having its stock quoted on an alternative trading platform like the Over-the-Counter (OTC) exchange to a major stock exchange like Nasdaq.It is essentially moving up the stock market food chain as the stocks of a company get bigger and more successful.The reason for uplisting is threefold.First institutional investors and hedge funds prefer large stock exchanges over OTC because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough liquidity.Second since larger stock exchanges have more stringent requirements it gives a greater sense of legitimacy \xe2\x80\x94 allowing better investors to take part. For example companies that want to list on the Nasdaq are required to have 1.25 million public shares held by at least 550 shareholders with a collective market value of $45 million.And moving to a major exchange like Nasdaq offers greater visibility \xe2\x80\x94 making it the best place for a company to have access to more investors from around the world.Promising Future for Clean Energy Stocks on NasdaqNasdaq attracts many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading companies today: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA).This is largely because of the way Nasdaq has embraced innovation in its trading platform for companies in technology as well as companies in other cutting-edge industries like clean energy.The transition toward a cleaner future has become clearer in the recent past because of political and economical actions. The green initiative is backed by President Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s $2.3 trillion investment proposal in infrastructure.An investment of this scale spells good news for top clean energy stocks and allows investors to jump on the bandwagon in many ways. Clean energy stocks also benefit when oil and gas stocks tumble. And with more consumers moving toward EV vehicles the shift from fossil fuels is inevitable.Many clean energy IPOs have also performed well in the recent past. One such company is FuelCell Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL). In 2019 the stock was trading in the 50-cent range for most of the year. But around November 2020 there was increased interest in the stock. Volume came in and the stock broke out above $1 in December. As of June 29 2021 the stock is trading at $9.75.Similarly other clean energy companies like Sunworks Inc. (NASDAQ: SUNW) and VivoPower (NASDAQ: VVPR) experienced great results at the end of their IPOs as their stocks went supernova.Uplisting Implications for WorksportRecent information about the company\xe2\x80\x99s plan to launch a subsidiary company TerraVis Energy suggests that the company might be using hydrogen fuel cells and allow EV charging where it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thought possible.With Worksport\xe2\x80\x99s existing robust product line of tonneau covers its revolutionary TerraVis\xe2\x84\xa2 system upcoming advanced TerraVis COR\xe2\x84\xa2 mobile energy storage potential Nasdaq uplisting and the company\xe2\x80\x99s plan to launch a new subsidiary the future looks sunny for the company.Worksport is a partner of Benzinga.

All rights reserved. 1125 N. Charles St Baltimore MD 21201.SHORT-SQUEEZE STOCKSToday's Top 10 Stocks With High Short-Interest >>> READ MORESponsored byHome / Today's Market / 12 Most Highly Shorted Stocks Heading Into Q3 2021\xe2\x80\x9cShort squeeze\xe2\x80\x9d is surely one of the top buzzwords of 2021. Unprecedented rallies in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) have set retail traders\xe2\x80\x99 sights on stocks that have a high short interest. This style of investing is still gaining momentum \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s highly speculative \xe2\x80\x94 but the payoffs can be absolutely massive. Obviously there are plenty of investors looking to take their chances with this potentially lucrative strategy. So with that in mind what are some of the most highly shorted stocks now?Source: ShutterstockShort squeeze stocks aren\xe2\x80\x99t a new thing but this type of retail-driven investing is highly unusual.Investors coordinate to buy stocks which are being heavily shorted. The goal is to inflate the price ahead of the expiration of the short sellers\xe2\x80\x99 margin calls. If prices increase rather than decrease short sellers will have to buy stock back to limit losses in turn sending prices up more. The result if executed correctly is a very fast increase in stock prices.GameStop is the primary example of a short squeeze in 2021. Short sellers had targeted the brick-and-mortar retailer thanks to its old-school business model debt and the Covid-19 pandemic. r/WallStreetBets rallied behind it pushing its prices continually higher. GME stock is over 1000% higher in the year to date.Investors Seek Out Highly Shorted Stocks in Q3Going into the third quarter there are still a large number of institutions short-selling different stocks. According to S3 Partners this is despite the losses short-sellers continue to face thanks to these coordinated squeezes. S3 says the\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cyear-to-date net-of-financing mark-to market losses in the U.S. market are -$168.96 billion a -15.45% on an average short interest of $1.09 trillion.\xe2\x80\x9dThe firm also said that 25% of the year\xe2\x80\x99s short side losses occurred in the last 30 days alone draining over $44 billion from short sellers.Alongside these comments S3 Partners is updating investors on the stocks with the highest short interest going into Q3. The list includes 12 different stocks like Workhorse (NASDAQ:WKHS) and\xc2\xa0Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) which both have huge followings on r/WallStreetBets. Roughly 34% of Workhorse\xe2\x80\x99s float is short while nearly 37% of Clover Health\xe2\x80\x99s float is short.10 Other Short Squeeze Targets to WatchAlso included are a number of electric vehicle stocks. This group is highly competitive and such institutions are betting on a lot of these names to fizzle out. Joining WKHS are four other EV stocks on the list. Arcimoto (NASDAQ:FUV) has 37.85% of its float sold short. Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) is seeing short interest of 26.83%. Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) have short interest of 13.26% and 30.78% respectively.Biotech and pharma companies are cooling off in the market as we move closer to a post-pandemic age. As such Esperion Therapeutics\xc2\xa0(NASDAQ:ESPR) and Fulgent Genetics (NASDAQ:FLGT) are both on the list with short interest of 44.66% and 28.52%. Rounding out the list are a ragtag group of other plays. SPAC Altimeter (NASDAQ:AGC) has a short percentage of 33.57%. Grocer Albertson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE:ACI) makes the list with short interest of 10.84%. Advertising company PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM) appears with 31.89% of its float being sold short. Finally in-flight internet provider Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO) finishes the list with short interest of 13.07%.On the date of publication Brenden Rearick\xc2\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xc2\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xc2\xa0Publishing Guidelines.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/07/12-most-highly-shorted-stocks-heading-into-q3-2021/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceBest Crypto & Blockchain Right NowIs There Anything to Love About Baby Doge Coin?By Luke Lango and the InvestorPlace Research StaffJul 5 2021Market Insight Financial ArticlesThe Widening Wealth GapBy Jeff RemsburgJul 4 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithJul 6 2021ADVERTISEMENTTop StoriesJul 6 2021Short-Squeeze Stocks: Today\xe2\x80\x99s Top 10 Stocks With High Short InterestJul 6 2021CLOV Stock: The Big Catalyst That Has Clover Health Stumbling TodayJul 6 2021Shiba Inu Crypto News: Investors Are Howling for the Brand-New #ShibaSwapJul 6 2021Reddit Stocks: Why AMC WISH GME CLOV and NOK Are Trending TodayJul 6 2021MMAT Stock: The Big News Lifting Meta Materials TodayADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

Matt specializes in writing about bank stocks REITs and personal finance but he loves any investment at the right price. Follow him on Twitter to keep up with his latest work!Follow @TMFMathGuyThere\'s a general consensus among stock market experts that some of the major "meme stocks" -- including GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) -- aren\'t going to work out well for investors who buy them at the current share prices. On the other hand there are some popular meme stocks that could indeed be capable of 10X returns or even more if things go well. In this Fool Live video clip\xc2\xa0recorded on June 25 Fool.com contributor Matt Frankel CFP and Chief Growth Officer Anand Chokkavelu discuss which of these popular stocks could provide the biggest returns to shareholders over the next few years.Anand Chokkavelu: If you had to guess which one could 10X from here do you have any strong contenders?Matt Frankel: It depends what our time frame is.Chokkavelu: 10 years.Frankel: If you were going to say 20 years Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) would be my number one. I think they have a 100X potential but in 20 or 30 years from now. I just think it\'s way too early. As far as a quicker 10X I would say maybe Clean Energy (NASDAQ:CLNE) maybe Corsair (NASDAQ:CRSR) -- probably be between those two. Probably Corsair I\'d have to give it to.Chokkavelu: We talked about Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) if it hits really big. I could see that. ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) Wish. This is the upside. Even something like BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) if everything works out as it is. Corsair I\'m not as bullish on a 10X but maybe perhaps. This isn\'t the strongest contender list.Frankel: I like how you brought up that they have some adjacent market opportunities. Like you and me we\'re not video gamers but those chairs look pretty comfortable. Their headsets might be better than just standard headsets for our purposes. There is a lot of adjacent opportunities. I could see the gig economy really growing over the next decade or so them having a lot of opportunity to expand on that. People like me and you spend a lot of money on stuff like office furniture and tech equipment. I could see them really benefiting off that if they do things right.Chokkavelu: My point $3 billion market cap when we\'re talking about AMC (NYSE:AMC) with $30 billion.Frankel: I know you\'re normally the one asking the questions. I\'m interested to know who\'s your zero-X leader.Chokkavelu: I think we nailed it with Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and\xc2\xa0 AMC unless they can get that money quickly. But even something like Clover Health that we both like.Frankel: Oh it could that\'s a very binary stock.Chokkavelu: Yeah. Are there any other ones? Probably most of these could be.Frankel: As much as I don\'t like to say it I would have to say it\'s between Nikola and Virgin Galactic. I could see them running out of money before they really start turning serious revenue. I could see them having serious cash problems especially if we have like not a COVID recession where it was like we had a recession that lasted a couple of months. Like if the financial crisis happens again and\xc2\xa0 investment just dries up and things like that. I could see them running out of money. I could see them being a very economically sensitive business.Chokkavelu: Yeah. Even something like GameStop (NYSE:GME) which now has good balance sheet strength. But if they get over their skis and go aggressive into trying to really pivot the business and use a lot of money to do that and then you see a concomitant share price drop where they can\'t just keep raising funds at $250 a share or whatever -- yeah that could be problematic.Frankel: Yeah. Right now all the ones said have spiked this year especially. Now after today I guess I could put Virgin Galactic in that category. Their biggest advantage right now is being able to raise cheap capital. If that advantage goes away for a few of these companies especially the pre-revenue companies like Nikola and Virgin Galactic I can see that becoming a real problem.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

The 2021 Russel rebalance \xe2\x80\x94 which came into effect on Jun 28 before the opening bell \xe2\x80\x94 saw various electric vehicle (EV) stocks making an entry to the small-cap specific Russell 2000 Index underscoring the soaring popularity of e-mobility amid changing dynamics of the auto industry.\xc2\xa0Among various electric and driverless technology-related stocks that have been added to the Russell Index seven EV companies \xe2\x80\x94 most of which went public last year \xe2\x80\x94 joined the Index. These include Canoo Inc. GOEV Fisker Inc. FSR Hyliion Holdings HYLN Lordstown Motors RIDE Nikola NKLA Arcimoto Inc. FUV and XL Fleet XL. With these firms joining Russell 2000 and EV trends getting hotter by the day do the stocks deserve a spot on your portfolio as well? Let\xe2\x80\x99s analyze.Wait-And-See Approach is Appropriate for CanooCanoo made its Nasdaq debut on Dec 22 2020\xc2\xa0by merging with Hennessy Capital Acquisition.\xc2\xa0The stock has declined around 47% since its IPO. The company is in the pre-revenue stage and plans to launch its first lifestyle vehicle in late 2022 following it up with a delivery vehicle in 2023 and sports vehicle in 2025.On its investor day held in June Canoo claimed to meet its commitment of commencing delivery of lifestyle vehicles in fourth-quarter 2022 by parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing. The company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO tried his best to restore investors\xe2\x80\x99 lost faith in the stock because of fundamental changes in the business model (announced during fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call). Bank of America acknowledged the event as\xe2\x80\x9d relatively constructive\xe2\x80\x99 while reiterating its \xe2\x80\x98Underperform\xe2\x80\x99 rating on the stock.While Canoo has the proprietary skateboard technology platform in place it remains to be seen how the company will be able to make the most out it. If you already own the stock you may choose to stay invested; but we don\xe2\x80\x99t advise you to invest in this EV maker at the moment because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a proven track record and has a long road ahead to build a strong name for itself in an overcrowded EV market. Canoo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\xc2\xa0the complete list of today\xe2\x80\x99s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesFisker is Not Convincing EnoughFisker made NYSE debut on Oct 30 2020 via a merger with Spartan Energy Acquisition an affiliate of Apollo Global Management.\xc2\xa0The stock has surged around 90% since its IPO. The company is yet to begin production and has not generated any revenues to date. Fisker is set to begin production of its first vehicle the Ocean electric SUV in fourth-quarter 2022. The firm claims that its Ocean SUV has a range of 250-300 miles on a single recharge.\xc2\xa0Last month the company announced an ambitious plan to produce what could be the world\'s first "climate neutral" vehicle a car that will be built with minimum impact on the environment spanning from how the parts and components are sourced and assembled to the way the vehicle is charged and recycled. The company plans to roll out the vehicle by 2027 which seems to be a rather moonshot goal. What\xe2\x80\x99s more it projects $13 billion of revenues by 2025.Given that the company is still in the nascent stage and will take time to capture a niche in the EV landscape there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding its future. High execution risk and mounting capex and R&D costs remain headwinds. Considering its overly ambitious goals it would be prudent for investors to give the stock time to\xc2\xa0prove its\xc2\xa0mettle rather than jumping into buying it based on its promises. Fisker currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Hyliion is Not Worth Buying at the MomentHyliion made debut on the NYSE on Oct 2 2020 by merging with Tortoise Acquisition Corporation.\xc2\xa0The stock has declined 70% since its IPO. The EV startup intends to supply electric and hybrid powertrain solutions to truck makers. Hyliion\xe2\x80\x99s biggest rewarding point is that it can retrofit its technology on the existing fleets.\xc2\xa0However the firm has not generated any revenue yet. Inflated research and development costs on advanced technologies will continue to play a major spoilsport for its bottom line especially till the firm doesn\xe2\x80\x99t generate significant revenues.While Hyliion claims that its business model is efficient one should not forget that meaningful deliveries are still a couple of years away.\xc2\xa0Any possible delays in the delivery deadline and production challenges might create problems. As it is the firm\xe2\x80\x99s lofty valuation and high leverage raise a red flag.\xc2\xa0Considering the headwinds surrounding the firm it\xe2\x80\x99s prudent to avoid exposure to the stock now. Hyliion currently carries a Zacks Rank #4.Bumpy Ride Awaits LordstownLordstown made NASDAQ debut on Oct 26 2020 after completing a reverse merger with DiamondPeak Holdings. The stock has declined 42% since its IPO. Boasting 600 horsepower and a range exceeding 250 miles on a single recharge Lordstown Endurance is one of the most anticipated electric pickups. However the company is in murky waters at the moment.In March Hindenburg Research issued a report accusing Lordstown of misleading investors about the demand for its upcoming electric pick-up truck. This was followed by SEC investigations on the allegations made by Hindenburg. In June the probe concluded that the Hindenburg report was false for most significant matters but it did point out flaws regarding the accuracy of statements pertaining to the pre-orders for the Endurance truck. On the same day the news of Burns\xe2\x80\x99 and Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s (CEO and CFO of Lordstown) resignations surfaced.What\xe2\x80\x99s more Lordstown recently warned that it may have insufficient capital to commence full-scale commercial production of Endurance. The company in fact raised doubts about its ability to meet financial obligations over the next year.\xc2\xa0The above-mentioned series of unfortunate events and challenges faced by Lordstown make its chances of survival highly speculative and questionable. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4.Nikola is Only for High Risk-Tolerance InvestorsHydrogen truck maker Nikola got listed on Nasdaq after a reverse merger with VectoIQ on Jun 3 2020. The stock has declined 47% since its IPO. Nikola saw grueling times last year when its credibility was put to question following the scathing report from Hindenburg Research which slapped fraud allegations about the company. Following the fraud charges the company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Trevor Milton resigned which almost felt like an admission of guilt.Milton\xe2\x80\x99s exaggerated promises and tall claims fell through big time putting investors in a fix. This massive reputational damage also prompted\xc2\xa0General Motors\xc2\xa0to scale down its deal with Nikola.\xc2\xa0Nikola\xe2\x80\x99s Badger EV pickup \xe2\x80\x94 which was touted as the \xe2\x80\x9cmost bad ass zero emission truck\xe2\x80\x9d by Milton \xe2\x80\x94 has been abandoned altogether. Notwithstanding Nikola\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with CNH Industrial and deal with Arizona Public Service are encouraging there\xe2\x80\x99s high risk associated with the stock.The firm neither possesses any breakthrough technology nor does it have any proven track record and fundamental strength. What it has though is a history of unfulfilled promises and tall claims and lots to prove. Therefore it should be avoided as of now.\xc2\xa0The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4.Arcimoto Serves as Another \xe2\x80\x98Prove it First\xe2\x80\x99 StoryThis Oregon-based EV maker went public in September 2017 with its shares increasing 198% since IPO. The firm has managed to gain popularity on the back of its uniquely designed flagship product the Fun Utility Vehicle (\xe2\x80\x9cFUV\xe2\x80\x9d) resonating well with the stock\xe2\x80\x99s ticker. The firm\xe2\x80\x99s five different product lines including its flagship \xe2\x80\x9cFUV\xe2\x80\x9d Deliverator Rapid Responder Cameo and Roadster cater to different niches. On Jun 24 2021 Arcimoto showcased its \xe2\x80\x9cFUV\xe2\x80\x9d and Deliverator during the Electric Mobility Symposium held in San Diego.While it took years for the company to start vehicle production rolling them out to customers will be another daunting task.\xc2\xa0Despite being in the business for more than a decade Arcimoto is still struggling with losses and is yet to turn a profit amid rising R&D as well as SG&A costs. While it aims for an annual production capacity of 50000 units within two years one can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore the fact that the firm does not have any track record of high-scale production.While its future product lineup strong balance sheet and partnership with Lightning Motorcycles for three-wheeled e-bikes bode well weak operating results high cash burn and lofty valuations raise concern. We don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend buying shares of Arcimoto at the current price levels. The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.XL Fleet is Relatively a Safer BetXL Fleet made NYSE debut on Dec 22 2020 after completing a merger with Pivotal Investment Corporation. The stock has declined around 52% since its IPO. The company does have a differentiated business model as it does not manufacture EVs and is rather engaged in configuring existing commercial and municipal vehicle fleets with electrification solutions.Unlike many of the other EV startups XL Fleet is generating revenues and has a large customer base underscoring its credibility. It registered $0.7 million sales in first-quarter 2021. Late last year the company forecast revenues of\xc2\xa0$75 million\xc2\xa0for fiscal 2021. That may be difficult for the firm now considering the supply chain issues and key shortages of raw materials as notified by the company. However XL Fleet believes the same to only cause temporary hiccups and anticipates increased demand and revenue visibility in second-half 2021.XL Fleet is working toward expanding the product lineup (to include BEVs and HFCVs) as well as serving capabilities and international footprint. However mounting operating costs are acting as a killjoy. In the last reported quarter the SG&A more than tripled from the year-ago levels. Even though XL Fleet expansion efforts may prove costly it still stands a better chance to capitalize on the e-mobility boom than many of the budding EV companies at the moment.Zacks Names \xe2\x80\x9cSingle Best Pick to Double\xe2\x80\x9dFrom thousands of stocks 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

Motley FoolWhy Tesla Stock Fell on TuesdayShares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) fell on Tuesday down 3.7% at 12:25 p.m.The electric-car maker\'s stock was down likely for two primary reasons: a bearish day for the stock market overall and some comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the weekend about how rolling out self-driving-like features for its vehicle fleet has been more difficult than expected.In response to a Tesla owner teasing Musk on Twitter for missing a deadline to roll out the next beta version of Tesla\'s "self-driving" technology (which notably requires drivers to be fully attentive at the wheel and ready to take over) the CEO admitted over the three-day weekend that he hadn\'t expected achieving "generalized self-driving" to be "so hard but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect."3h agoMotley FoolWhy These China Stocks Are Plummeting TodayWhat happened The stocks of nearly 200 companies that call China home are in the red on Tuesday many because regulators in that country cracked down on a number of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.

It is focusing $50 million on clean H2 to be used in fuel cell trucks by Midwest customers.The electric truck maker has acquired 20 percent of Wabash Valley Resources LLC.Nikola has taken a 20 percent stake in Wabash Valley Resources which has launched a clean H2 project In West Terre Haute Indiana. That project will be using solid waste byproducts such as a combination of biomass and petroleum coke for the production of clean and sustainable H2. This hydrogen fuel investment will make Nikola a part of the production of the H2 which will be used as transportation fuel and base-load electricity generation. It will use carbon capture methods and will store the captured CO2 underground to help decarbonize the renewable energy\xe2\x80\x99s production.The electric truck maker\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to establish a reliable hydrogen fuel source for supporting the operation of H2-powered trucks. These H2 production would be located on lanes within a 300-mile radius of freight-intensive states to supply refueling stations. In time Nikola\xe2\x80\x99s intention is to establish a hub capable of producing 50 tons of H2 per day to supply its refueling stations across a considerable portion of the Midwestern US.This hydrogen fuel investment will help to support the company\xe2\x80\x99s broader strategies.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a good thing\xe2\x80\x9d said Guidehouse Insights principal analyst Sam Abuelsamid as quoted in a recent freightwaves.com report. \xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge is going to be if they do have to truck the hydrogen in. That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a significant hit to the whole carbon neutrality component of this.\xe2\x80\x9dNikola expects to further its hydrogen fuel investment in this project for establishing liquefaction storage and transportation services. The company is currently selling as much as $300 million in new shares to Tumim Stone Capital as well as a family office in Toronto. Its intentions include offering as much as $1.5 billion in new shares by way of a follow-on stock offering and will sell some of its convertible debt as early as this summer.Loading...CategoryFeatured News Financial Hydrogen Fuel Cell TagsMidwest US H2 trucks Nikola H2 trucks Nikola hydrogen truck investment Nikola hydrogen trucks Nikola Midwest US hydrogen investmentLoop Energy passes 75000 km fuel cell bus fleet operation milestone in ChinaLondon\xe2\x80\x99s first hydrogen double decker bus hits the streets2 CommentsStan Thompson says:July 1 2021 at 8:03 amNext on Nicola\xe2\x80\x99s list should be central to eastern North Carolina.
