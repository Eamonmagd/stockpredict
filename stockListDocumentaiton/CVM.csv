b'Can Brazil set a new IPO record?', b'19 hours ago', b'After registering 28 IPOs last year the local stock exchange is projected to see ... currently there are another 43 under evaluation by securities regulator CVM.Can Brazil set a new IPO record? - BNamericasAbout usSolutionsClientsFree DemoLoginEspa\xc3\xb1olAnalysisCan Brazil set a new IPO record?BnamericasPublished: Tuesday April 13 2021Private InvestmentCommoditiesEconomicsMergers & AcquisitionsFinancial instrumentsDespite a background of economic and political turmoil amid the pandemic Brazilian companies and banks are eyeing fertile ground in the capital markets.\xc2\xa0 After registering 28 IPOs last year the local stock exchange is projected to see even more operations in 2021 with some players saying there could be a record number. In 2007 when Brazil was riding a commodities boom there were a record 64 IPOs. In the first quarter of this year there were 16 IPOs and currently there are another 43 under evaluation by securities regulator CVM. "We\xe2\x80\x99re living in a paradoxical situation where I myself confess that I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised as historically IPOs are linked to positive economic cycles which is not what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Brazil at the moment" Alex Agostini chief economist at local ratings agency Austin Rating told BNamericas. After contracting 4.1% in 2020 due to the effects of the pandemic expectations for this year were optimistic but analysts are now being more cautious given the slow roll-out of vaccinations. "We\xe2\x80\x99re likely to have a first half of economic retraction with a more solid recovery only in the second half" said Gustavo Arruda chief economist at BNP Paribas Brasil during a press conference. Arruda projects Brazil\'s GDP will expand a modest 2.5% this year. However companies are pushing ahead with more and more IPOs. The trend is largely explained by the fact that the benchmark Selic rate is at\xc2\xa02.75% considered low in historic terms and below annual inflation of around 5%. With the low interest rates investors are looking to equities to generate higher returns. The situation led to a mass migration of investors to the equity markets. In 2020 the number of retail investors in Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s equity market totaled 3.23mn compared with 620000 in 2017 according to Agostini. "Another important point behind the IPO wave is that companies have seen that it\xe2\x80\x99s much cheaper to improve their respective governance policies and raise money via the capital market than to finance them through bank loans" said Agostini. M&As Including IPOs and follow-ons companies raised 33.4bn reais\xc2\xa0(US$5.86bn) in the first quarter of 2021 up from 31.2bn reais in the year-ago period according to capital markets association Anbima. "A major portion of proceeds raised from IPOs will be used in the expansion plans of companies and also in M&A opportunities" Anbima director Jos\xc3\xa9 Eduardo Laloni told a conference in response to a BNamericas question. According to Laloni the situation is different to that of the 2000s when most operations involved big companies and most shares were acquired by international investors.\xc2\xa0 "Today the local capital market is more robust because there are more small and medium-size companies listing shares and operations involve more domestic investors" said the Anbima head.To continue reading subscribe to BNamericas to get all the information in this article and access to related news items and reports.Free DemoFree DemoNews in: Banking (Brazil)MercadoLibre to invest US$1.75bn in Brazil in 2021Other highlights include Mexico surpassing Argentina in Q4 in terms of units sold and Chile becoming the fastest-growing market for the company.Free insurance may boost crypto interest in LatAm says regional trailblazer BitsoBitso has more than 1.3mn clients in Latin America and is the first platform of its kind in the region to provide free insurance to users.How ratings agencies assess Brazil\'s current sovereign risksBolsonaro moves into damage control modePolitical interference in Brazil\'s economy gives investors the jittersSustainable finance on the rise in BrazilVaccine drives could give LatAm dealmaking 2021 boostFEBRABAN and IFC join forces to encourage sustainable finance\'The green bond market offers an interesting financing option for infra projects\'Brazil\'s BNDES to structure more sanitation concessions in AlagoasSee more newsSubscribe to BNamericas and gain access to thousands of project profiles key contacts and news.Free DemoOther projectsGet key information on thousands of projects in Latin America from current stage to capex related companies key contacts and more.
