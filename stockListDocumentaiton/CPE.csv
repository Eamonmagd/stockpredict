Callon Petroleum (CPE) which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry could be a great candidate to consider.This independent oil and gas company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 235.28%.For the last reported quarter Callon came out with earnings of $1 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.41 per share representing a surprise of 143.90%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $0.15 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.64 per share delivering a surprise of 326.67%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Callon lately. In fact the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive which is a great indicator of an earnings beat particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Callon currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.25% which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company\'s earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock\'s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But a negative value is not indicative of a stock\'s earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this it\'s really important to check a company\'s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\'ve reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamCoinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.5h agoReutersGold prices ease as equities rally outweighs softer dollarGold prices inched lower on Wednesday as a record rally in global equity markets offset support for bullion from a softer dollar and data showing a jump in U.S. inflation.Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1743 per ounce as of 1013 GMT."Gold reacted positively to the U.S. inflation data because bond yields were down and the dollar was also weaker and so that certainly lend support to gold" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.11h agoReutersTaiwan says its chip firms will adhere to new U.S. rules blacklisting China supercomputing entitiesTaiwan said on Wednesday its chip companies will adhere to U.S. rules after Washington added seven Chinese supercomputing entities last week to an economic blacklist and after a Taipei-based chipmaker halted orders from one of the entities named.The U.S. Commerce Department said the seven Chinese entities were "involved with building supercomputers used by China\'s military actors its destabilizing military modernisation efforts and/or weapons of mass destruction programs."Companies or others listed on the U.S. Entity List are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.11h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Red Gobo | Search AdsWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdCost of Luxury Cruises in 2021 Is Turning HeadsCruise Prices In 2021 May Make Your Jaw Drop The TelegraphBernie Madoff financier behind world\'s biggest Ponzi scheme dies in prisonFinancier Bernie Madoff who was sentenced to 150 years in jail after pleading guilty to organising the world\'s biggest investing scam has died in prison aged 82. Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h agoBenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

ReutersLearn from Alibaba penalty China warns internet firmsChina\'s market regulator fresh from fining e-commerce giant Alibaba $2.75 billion said on Tuesday it warned nearly three dozen internet companies to stop using any banned practices such as forcing vendors to use their platform exclusively.The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it summoned 34 companies including Tencent ByteDance and JD.com for a meeting where it ordered them to conduct self-inspections within one month warning of"severe punishment" for any that still violated the rules.In February China issued new anti-monopoly guidelines targeting internet platforms.1d agoBloombergTikTok Founder\'s $60 Billion Fortune Places Him Among The World\'s Richest People(Bloomberg) -- Just last year the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable startup ByteDance Ltd. was being squeezed from all sides.The Trump administration wanted the Chinese firm which owns the ubiquitous TikTok video-sharing platform to get rid of assets. Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce.

BloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d agoCoinDeskBitRiver Is Selling Tokens to Build More Bitcoin Mining Farms in SiberiaMining company BitRiver is launching its own token aiming to raise $35 million on Bithumb2d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2History A2ZWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdEpic Clothing Fails That Are Too Good To Be TrueHard to believe these clothing fails actually exist ReutersBitcoin hits record before landmark Coinbase listing on NasdaqLONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin hit a record of $62741 on Tuesday extending its 2021 rally to new heights a day before the listing of Coinbase shares in the United States.The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange\'s listing on the Nasdaq on Wednesday is considered a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates.Bitcoin is the world\'s biggest cryptocurrency with growing mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment.1d agoBloombergFirst Bitcoin ETF in North America Hits $1 Billion in Assets(Bloomberg) -- Less than two months after launching the first North American Bitcoin ETF already reached $1 billion (C$1.25 billion) in assets according to a statement from its issuer.

(NASDAQ: HOLI) (the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd) disclosed certain financial condition and results of operations for the six-month period ended December 31 2020 together with its review and analysis of the comparable six-month period in 2019. The Company attempted to \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93highlight\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd selected financial metrics and sought to convince the public that the Company is on the right track under the current management. But a close look at these data actually reveals significantly deteriorating financial and operational conditions of the Company since the removal of previous management in July 2020.Dramatic Increase in Accounts Receivable and Substantial Deterioration in Net Cash Highlight Financial Struggle of Core Business ActivitiesRevenue for the six-month period ended December 31 2020 was $324.8 million while accounts receivable increased by $84.2 million during such period; revenue for the correlating period in 2019 was $293.3 million while accounts receivable decreased by $43.1 million during such period. Increase in accounts receivable represented approximately 26% of revenue for the six-month period ended December 31 2020 while approximately \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x80\x9c14.7% for the correlating period in 2019. Although the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s total assets grew by $208.1 million between July and December 2020 the increase in accounts receivable contributed to more than 40% of increase in assets. It is apparent that the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s modest growth in revenue and assets were largely due to a dramatic increase in accounts receivable which is neither desirable nor sustainable.Moreover net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended December 31 2020 was $55.0 million compared to $109.4 million for the correlating period in the prior year. Such a rapid and substantial deterioration in cash-generating abilities highlights the financial struggle of the Company's core business activities.Poor Cost Control Inadequate Investment in Core Technologies and Reduced Net IncomeWith selling G&A and R&D expenses increasing across the board total operating expenses increased by $11.1 million or 21.4% significantly outpacing the 10.7% increase in revenue for the same period. Such disproportional increase in expenses manifests the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s inability to control costs which is vital to the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s success. Further although R&D expenses increased by 18.2% the Company failed to invest in core technologies. The R&D section of the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s latest disclosure included no new technology or R&D initiatives since the removal of previous management. As a result of the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s poor cost control and inability to innovate its net income dropped by 19%.Slight Increase in Backlog Attributable Entirely to Prior Contracts under Previous ManagementAlthough total backlog (unrealized revenue from earned contracts) increased by 2% from $587 million at the end of 2019 to $601.3 million at the end of 2020 only $170.1 million at the end of 2020 was attributable to new contracts signed between July and December 2020 comparing to $236.7 million at the end of 2019 from new contracts signed in the comparable period a close to 30% decline. Concurrently the backlog attributable to contracts signed in prior periods but still uncompleted increased from $350.3 million at the end of 2019 to $431.2 million at the end of 2020 a more than 23% increase. It is evident that the slight increase in total backlog was entirely attributable to prior contracts entered into under previous management.J.P. Morgan Analysts\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 Report and Lowered Price Target of $15 Per ShareOn March 30 2021 J.P. Morgan released its analysts\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2 report and lowered its forecast of the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stock price from $16.1 per share (as of December 21 2020) to $15 per share. J.P. Morgan stated in the report that the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s outlook \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93looks muted in light of: 1) limited visibility with regard to CRC\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s train procurement as order flow in 1HFY21 remained sluggish (-4.2% Y/Y); and 2) muted demand growth for China\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s process automation demand during CY2021 particularly for the part of PA spend related to power plants to which [the Company] has greater exposure.\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd It also noted that the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stock price as of March 29 2021 was at $12.64.Statement of the ConsortiumIt is clear that existing management and the board of directors of the Company do not know how to run the business successfully. Since our last press release of March 21 2021 the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s stock price has further declined. The closing price of April 12 2021 dropped to $12.74 more than 25% lower than the $17.10 offer price provided in the proposal (the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Proposal\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd) by the buyer consortium consisting of Mr. Shao Baiqing Ace Lead Profits Limited and CPE Funds Management Limited (the \xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc5\x93Consortium\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xef\xbf\xbd). The Consortium strongly believes that the $17.10 offer price provides a highly attractive control premium to shareholders as evidenced by the Company\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s dismal stock price and struggling operations and further supported by the price target of $15 based on J.P. Morgan\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s DCF valuation model.The board is obligated to fulfill its fiduciary duties and act in the best interests of the shareholders. To that end the board should immediately convene a shareholder meeting for the shareholders to consider and vote on the Proposal. The board should also take all necessary corporate action to render the shareholder rights plan inapplicable to the Proposal as the Proposal offers all shareholders other than the Consortium with a compelling premium in a fair and equal manner and is not the type of takeover that the rights plan intends to prevent. Short of those actions the board would find themselves at great risk of violating their fiduciary duties to the shareholders.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210413006213/en/Jinxiang Guo Executive DirectorCPE Funds Management LimitedPhone: +86-10-8507-8517Email: guojinxiang@cpe-fund.comSource: CPE Funds Management LimitedSerious News for Serious Traders!Try StreetInsider.com Premium Free!Create E-mail AlertRelated CategoriesBusiness Wire Press ReleasesRelated EntitiesJPMorganSign up for StreetInsider Free!Receive full access to all new and archived articles unlimited portfolio tracking e-mail alerts custom newswires and RSS feeds - and more!Free News FeedGet our RSS Feed!\xc2\xa9 Copyright 2021 StreetInsider.comHomeMember's HomePremium ContentLinksEntitiesAbout StreetInsiderGet Our ContentAdvertise with UsContact UsDisclaimerPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal Information", b'https://www.streetinsider.com/Business%2BWire/Buyer%2BConsortium%2BComments%2Bon%2BRecent%2BFinancial%2Band%2BOperational%2BInformation%2BReleased%2Bby%2BHollysys%2BAutomation%2BTechnologies/18257612.html'

Scopia Capital Management an investor that has been buying Harmonic shares in recent years and now holds a stake of 9.8% in the supplier now has the right to appoint two directors to Harmonic\'s board of directors during the next year. Scopia has also pledged to support Harmonic\'s slate of nominees at the upcoming 2021 annual meeting "and abide by customary standstill and other provisions."According to an April 12 SEC filing Jerome Lande partner and head of special situations for Scopia has been identified as the first of two Scopia appointees.While heavier involvement from an activist shareholder is sure to draw attention this cooperation agreement did lead to some speculation that it could mean Harmonic is under pressure to sell a piece of its video segment business so it can put more focus on cable. Or maybe sell the whole thing to a company such as CommScope that might covet Harmonic\'s "CableOS" technology and its growing relationship with Comcast.OK fair enough. However a statement from Harmonic CEO Patrick Harshman about the agreement with Scopia indicates that he likes Harmonic\'s current trajectory. "We are continuing to build on the momentum in our Cable Access and Video segments. We remain very excited about our future opportunities" he said.But then that speculation got a bit wilder wondering if the planned spin-out of CommScope\'s Home Networks business which includes set-top boxes and cable modems might make for a good combination with Harmonic\'s assets.Huh? To me that doesn\'t even qualify as a reach. Such a transaction would seem to make less than zero sense for Harmonic which has been focused on access network infrastructure video processing and network software \xe2\x80\x93 nowhere near the consumer premises equipment (CPE) market. Or maybe I am just blind and stupid. I\'m not blind anyway.The reasoning for Scopia\'s increased involvement in Harmonic\'s affairs appears to be much more benign.According to Harmonic Scopia had expressed interest in engaging more actively with the vendor which followed with the dialogue that resulted in this week\'s agreement.A 13-D filing from March sheds a bit more light on Scopia\'s motivations and they appear fairly straightforward.Scopia acquired a bigger stake "for investment purposes in the belief that the shares of [Harmonic] Common Stock are undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity" Scopia explained. Scopia added that it might talk up other shareholders industry analysts and other third parties about Harmonic\'s business capital structure and management but didn\'t signal that it was looking to make any major or abrupt changes or was looking for Harmonic to actually do anything different.In any case a cooperation agreement that appeared to make a possible activist shareholder less active calmed some nerves. And if its intentions truly are fixated on boosting the value of Harmonic stock that seems to be working: Harmonic shares closed today at $8.81 up $0.73 (9.03%).Related posts:Scopia cuts deal to appoint two Harmonic board directorsHarmonic \'CableOS\' rollouts rise to 44 customers 2.6M cable modemsComcast Commits Millions to Harmonic\'s \'CableOS\' Platform\xe2\x80\x94 Jeff Baumgartner Senior Editor Light ReadingLike what we have to say?

Last week\'s announcement gives CommScope nearly a year to execute the spin-off leaving ample time for the company and its board to explore other possibly more lucrative optionsthat might surface along the way. That to me signals that CommScope would still be game for some old-fashioned M&A.And let us not forget that Joe Chow the CommScope exec who leads Home Networks today and is poised to be the CEO of the spin-out is no stranger to the M&A game \xe2\x80\x93 he was one of the main players at Cisco when the company sold its CPE business to Technicolor in 2015.Will Chow repeat the feat? Will CommScope find that elusive buyer? Or will it team with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in a deal that eventually transitions that business to said partner? Or can a spun-out company figure out a way to survive and perhaps thrive in a tough video CPE market that is being partly offset by a white-hot broadband sector? What will be the end game (for now)?We won\'t know that answer for months. But for now it seems a good time to offer a bit of a retrospective on the paths that were traveled and the deals that were done to get things to this point. After all it still doesn\'t seem all that long ago when much of the cable set-top chatter used to center on the old General Instrument/Motorola \xe2\x80\x93 Scientific-Atlanta/Cisco duopoly. Yet it also seems so far away.If you\'re an industry vet who slogged through the duopoly and the rise of cable digital video the vendor consolidation that followed and are now witnessing CommScope\'s latest move you might with apologies to David Byrne be asking yourself:via GIPHYThere\'s no perfect place to start. But in my mind this seems like a moment that helped to set this whole thing into motion:September 2009: Arris buys DigeoBack when the Motorola-Cisco duopoly was still a thing Arris bought into the set-top market by putting up $20 million for the assets of Digeo a Paul Allen-backed maker of video devices and on-screen guides software. Digeo was among the first suppliers to really get behind the concept of a whole-home DVR and today\'s common gateway-client setups.Moxi Digital has roots going back to Rearden Steel a secretive startupthat Steve Perlman an entrepreneur tracing back to companies such as General Magic and WebTV got off the ground in 1999.Digeo didn\'t bring a lot of cable operator business to the table but it got Arris into the game and put the industry on notice that there could be more to come. Arris would eventually get out of the video software business and sell what included the former Digeo assets to Espial which was sold to Enghouse in 2019.August 2011: Google acquires Motorola MobilityGoogle inked a $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility a deal that provided Google with some important patents and intellectual property for its mobile business plus a bunch of cable CPE and networking assets that came along for the ride.While it became clear later that Android TV would become Google\'s path into the set-top box Google was only really interested in Motorola\'s patent portfolio and had no desire to hang onto Motorola\'s CPE and cable access biz. That led Google to seek out possible suitors. It was a weird time as speculation went in a dozen different directions about who would land the whole thing or forge a partnership that might look to split out Motorola Home\'s CPE and access networks business. Names in the rumor mill included Ericsson China\'s Huawei CommScope Juniper Networks Pace and Microsoft. ZTE was even mentioned in the scuttlebutt. Did I say it got weird? Hardly anyone predicted where it would actually end up.December 2012: Arris wins bid for Motorola HomeArris a company not yet known for swinging big deals or paying top dollar forked over $2.35 billion in cash and stock \xe2\x80\x93 near the top of the expected range \xe2\x80\x93 for Motorola Home.A Motorola DCT 6200 cable HD receiver.After chasing after this story for months I was out of pocket when it happened and remember it vividly \xe2\x80\x93 I was about to sit down for dinner with my family at Gullifty\'s in Bryn Mawr when a colleague Craig Matsumoto rang me from California to tell me the news was breaking\xe2\x80\xa6 so he got to carry word of the deal across the finish line. (Thanks for grabbing the story and allowing me to enjoy my meal Craig!) Suddenly Arris became the big dog of cable tech \xe2\x80\x93 on the access network and in the home.April 2015: Arris picks up PaceThree years later Arris went back to the till to snap up rival set-top maker Pacein a deal valued at $2.1 billion.With an already big video and broadband CPE position Arris would now get even bigger after tucking UK-based Pace under its wing. The Pace deal would also add some access network tech to the mix in the wake of its 2013 acquisition of Aurora Networks.November 2018: CommScope makes play for ArrisFollowing weeks of rumors CommScope and Arris formalized a $7.4 billion merger . It was a Back to the Future moment \xe2\x80\x93 more than 20 years earlier General Instrument split itself into three publicly traded companies: NextLevel Systems (a CPE business focused on the telco TV/IPTV market that later reassumed the General Instrument name and then sold it to Motorola in 2000) CommScope and General Semiconductor. The band was effectively getting back together.While the Arris deal did provide CommScope with valuable network infrastructure for cable PON and wireless it didn\'t take long for the rumors to fly about when or if CommScope would try to offload Arris\'s CPE business. Industry sources tell us that CommScope wasted little time hawking that unit around but could not find a willing buyer.And that gets us to where we are today\xe2\x80\xa6 with CommScope planning to spin out the Home Networks unit by the first quarter of 2022. Maybe.Scroll through our handy timeline below to see if you missed anything:\xe2\x80\x94 Jeff Baumgartner Senior Editor Light ReadingLike what we have to say?
