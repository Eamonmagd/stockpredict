Over the next few weeks I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give investors research that shows when meme stocks\xe2\x80\x99 valuations get crazy and they should sell. This week I focus on GameStopGMEand put it in the\xc2\xa0Danger Zone.Why Investors Need Independent ResearchWall Street isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the business of warning investors of the dangers in risky stocks because they make too much money from their trading volume and underwriting of debt and equity sales.Only independent firms are free to provide unconflicted research and navigate\xc2\xa0Wall Street conflicts\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0analyst biases. With\xc2\xa0new technology\xc2\xa0to cut through the deluge of data in financial filings and\xc2\xa0overcome the flaws\xc2\xa0in Wall Street research self-directed investors are better positioned than ever to make informed decisions.What\xe2\x80\x99s the Problem Here?The meme stock frenzy highlights the lack of reliable fundamental research which creates a vacuum for mis-information that elevates sources like Reddit to undue levels of influence and leads investors to lose perspective.MORE FOR YOUPalantir Technologies Stock Could Fall 17%98% Of CEOs Say Biden\xe2\x80\x99s Corporate Tax Rate Hike Will Hurt Their Companies According To SurveyCoinbase Is Not Worth $100B And Its Stock Could Double On Direct ListingWithout reliable fundamental research investors have no way of gauging whether a stock is expensive or cheap. Without a reliable measure of valuation investors have little choice but to gamble if they want to own stocks. The lack of reliable fundamental research is a big problem if we want the market to have integrity and not unfairly advantage those with better information.Figure 1: Mis-Information for Self-Directed Investors Is At an All-Time HighWall Street Bets MisInformationEveripediaMeme Stock #1: GameStop: Danger Zone Anywhere Above $45/shareGME was not worth owning anywhere above $45/share given the company\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentals as explained when I closed my\xc2\xa0Focus List: Long position\xc2\xa0in the stock\xc2\xa0in late January. Nevertheless the stock went on to climb as high as $347/share before taking a roller coaster path back to ~$185/share. See Figure 2.Figure 2: Fundamental Research to Know When to Sell GMEGME Fundamental Radar Danger Above 45New Constructs LLCTo give readers a sense of just how crazy overvalued the stock was at its peak I do the math and show how the business would have to perform to justify $347/share.\xe2\x80\x9cCrazy\xe2\x80\x9d at $347 Explained: Implies More Revenue Than Macy\xe2\x80\x99sMMy\xc2\xa0reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model\xc2\xa0is an excellent research tool to analyze the expectations implied by stock prices. To justify $347/share it shows that GameStop must:improve its\xc2\xa0profit margin\xc2\xa0to 5.5% (10-yr avg from 2010-19 is 3.9% & all-time high was 4.8% in 2008) andgrow revenue by 17% compounded annually through 2030 (above\xc2\xa0projected\xc2\xa0video game industry CAGR of 13% through 2027)In this\xc2\xa0scenario GameStop earns nearly $21 billion in revenue in 2030 or more than the trailing-twelve-months (TTM) revenue of Macy\xe2\x80\x99s (M)\xc2\xa0AutoZoneAZO and ChewyCHWY.

Each of these stocks were on Robinhood\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0restricted stocks list\xc2\xa0and each saw a major rise and fall in late January.I will also feature other meme stocks that trade at levels entirely disconnected from fundamental reality such as NetflixNFLXand TeslaTSLA.Figure 5: Meme Stocks Disconnected From Fundamental RealityMeme Stocks Disconnected From FundamentalsNew Constructs LLCDisclosure: David Trainer Kyle Guske II and Matt Shuler receive no compensation to write about any specific stock style or theme.[1]\xc2\xa0Only Core Earnings enable investors to overcome the inaccuracies omissions and biases in legacy fundamental data and research as proven in\xc2\xa0Core Earnings: New Data & Evidence a forthcoming paper in\xc2\xa0The Journal of Financial Economics\xc2\xa0written by professors at Harvard Business School (HBS) & MIT Sloan.Follow me on\xc2\xa0Twitter.\xc2\xa0Check out\xc2\xa0my\xc2\xa0website.\xc2\xa0David TrainerNew Constructs leverages reliable fundamental data to provide unconflicted insights into the fundamentals and valuation of private and public businesses.

Sonic or otherwise that means I tend to gravitate towards defense and aerospace stocks. But to tell the truth over the course of a dozen years writing for The Motley Fool I have covered -- and continue to cover -- everything from retailers to consumer goods stocks and from tech to banks to insurers as well. Follow me on Twitter or Facebook for the most important developments in defense & aerospace news and other great stories besides.Follow @RichSmithFoolWhat happenedShares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) -- the original meme stock -- dropped more than 12% in early trading Monday before recovering to about a 10% loss around 11:15 a.m. EDT.Don\'t blame Robinhood or Reddit or short-traders for this one though. Blame Ascendiant Capital Markets which downgraded GameStop stock to sell today.Image source: Getty Images.So whatAccording to StreetInsider.com this morning analysts at Irvine California-based Ascendiant cut GameStop stock to sell and assigned the video game and console retailer a $10 price target that implies there\'s another 93% worth of downside risk in the stock.The analyst warned that even with two new console launches in the fourth quarter GameStop earned the bulk of its Q4 2020 profit not from selling games and hardware but rather from reporting tax loss carryforwards from losses incurred in 2019 and earlier in 2020. As far as 2021 goes the company declined to give guidance last quarter citing uncertainty about how the pandemic would affect sales. And while online sales have grown at GameStop it also poses a problem for GameStop in its role as a reseller of physical game discs and cartridges -- because 70% of game sales these days are digital-only.Now whatIn short Ascendiant sees GameStop as a business model in terminal decline and the fact that its stock trades in the triple digits today warns the analyst is solely "due to the popularity of GameStop on Reddit chat boards and with Robinhood retail investors."The stock currently "appears to no longer trade on traditional fundamental valuations or metrics but on retail investors sentiment hope momentum and the powers of crowds." But once investors resume valuing GameStop on its (lack of) profits the "share prices will come back down to match its current weak results and outlook."The time to sell warns Ascendiant is before that happens. Not after.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Is it more than a meme stock? Is it worth spending time monitoring GME stock?Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comOr even buy it?I was bearish in my last article on GME stock. And I continue to be bearish. Very bearish. My independent conclusion is based on facts and financial data which I will discuss below.Fundamentals and GME StockIn my previous article in March titled my previous article headlined \xe2\x80\x9c11 Reasons to Avoid GameStop Stock Despite the Hype\xe2\x80\x9d some of the key points about the company included these seven:Declining sales growthNet income is negativeTotal shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity has collapsedA business plan that is not workingFree cash flow growth has been too weakDebt level has increasedLong-term growth is nonexistentSince that article was published shares of GME stock went from $132.35 per share to $184.50 per share \xe2\x80\x93 a gain of 40%. It is currently trading around $174.7 Big Names That Could Be the Next TeslaFor analysts to change their investment thesis on a stock dramatically from a \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation or vice versa fundamentals must change or a key catalyst should be present. What is the key catalyst now for GME? For me there is none.Will it be its digital evolution so that the video game retailer will conquer the industry in the U.S.? Because its business model so far does not work. The company is bringing in losses.And as I wrote before from a valuation perspective the book value per share for GME stock has collapsed in the most recent years. This is fact not emotion or opinion.Trading Volume Has DiminishedI am not a technical analyst at least not yet but I do know about technical analysis. And one of the catalysts in technical analysis for a stock to move higher is increased volume. GME stock has for the past several trading days witnessed trading volume collapsing. On March 25 2021 the trading volume was about 51 million shares. On April 6 2021 trading volume was 6.1 million shares.I am wondering. Could it be the case that on Jan. 22 when the stock had a trading volume of about 200 million shares and a closing price of $65.01 per share that it seems too pricey for early investors now two months later and a few days later?To me it could and I believe so. The stock is very overvalued now.Important Information to AnalyzeThe company recently announced preliminary sales results for the first nine weeks of the 2021 fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 In its statement GameStop said its global sales increased:\xe2\x80\x9cFor the first nine-weeks of fiscal 2021 total global sales increased approximately 11% from the nine weeks ended April 4 2020.February: the four-week period ended February 27 2021 total global sales increased approximately 5.3% from the four weeks ended February 29 2020.March: the five-week period ended April 2 2021total global sales increased approximately 18% from the five week period ended April 4 2020.\xe2\x80\x9dNow a caution about these results as they are based on preliminary sales performance. The official results upon the completion of the month-end and quarter are much more reliable. So I am skeptical about this data. This press release is for people who are bullish on GME stock.Shareholders Face DilutionAnother noteworthy press release from the company had bad news for investors. It announced an at-the-market equity offering program. The announcement said the company could sell up to 3.5 million shares.In addition GameStop said proceeds of the stock sale would be used \xe2\x80\x9cto further accelerate its transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening its balance sheet. The timing and amount of any sales will be determined by a variety of factors considered by the Company.\xe2\x80\x9dSo the first thing that comes up is stock dilution which is a negative thing for investors. And what is interesting to me is that in this press release the company mentions \xe2\x80\x9cIn no event will the Company sell more than 3500000 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Offering and aggregate gross proceeds will not exceed $1000000000.\xe2\x80\x9dI do not understand why this cap on the number of stocks offered. Investors may want to buy more depending on the price offered. If GME is to dominate the gaming and entertainment industry why place a cap?Yes the dilution is too bad for investors but what does the management think about it? I mean it is a smart move by the management although bad news for shareholders. And it is crucial to wait and see the effects of this equity offering program. How will actually the management use the proceeds?The cap on money to be raised does not make sense. You want as much cash as possible to have options to pursue your strategic vision. Pay off debt. Invest in the future. Be a dominant company. Lead the change not just be known as a meme stock and weird games in stock market history.Verdict on GameStop StockI am bearish on the GME stock. The stock dilution makes extreme valuation worse. And in the absence of real and measurable positive catalysts nothing has changed. I advise avoiding the stock. No real value is present now.On the date of publication Stavros Georgiadis CFA did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/gme-stock-gamestop-good-reasons-to-be-bearish/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

"Following" : "Follow"}}April 14 2021 3:41am301CommentsShare:GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) said Tuesday it is redeeming senior notes worth $216.4 million that were due in two years that would leave the company mostly debt-free.What Happened: The video-game chain had\xc2\xa0long-term debt of $216.4 million as of end-January according to the company\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory filing. It had last month retired $73.2 million senior notes due 2021.The company had in July 2020 raised about $216.4 million in senior notes due March 2023 in exchange for an equal amount of senior notes due March 2021.The Dallas Texas-headquartered company reported a narrower 2020 loss at $214.6 million on a revenue of $5.09 billion. Its sales have fallen in recent years as it has struggled to adapt to new-age digital downloads and free-to-play online games that have taken over the gaming world.But the CEO George Sherman believes the company entered 2021 strong citing a 23% rise in February same-store sales amid strong global demand for gaming hardware.Why It Matters:\xc2\xa0The company is trying to transform from a brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce marketplace competing with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). That\xe2\x80\x99s the vision of investor Ryan Cohen.Since Cohen joined GameStop\xe2\x80\x99s board earlier this year he has brought in new management including people who worked for him at Chewy the pet supply store he co-founded.The unusual event of a brick-and-mortar retailer becoming debt-free amid the COVID-19 pandemic follows a rally in GME stock driven primarily by users of Reddit\'s WallStreetBets community.Other stocks that saw the short squeeze included\xc2\xa0AMC Entertainment Inc.\xc2\xa0(NYSE: AMC)\xc2\xa0Nokia Oyj\xc2\xa0(NYSE: NOK)\xc2\xa0BlackBerry Ltd.\xc2\xa0(NYSE: BB) and\xc2\xa0Rocket Companies Inc. (NYSE: RKT).Price Action: Shares of GameStop closed 0.07% lower at $140.99 on Tuesday.Read Next:\xc2\xa0Is GameStop Making A Crypto NFT Foray?Photo by Mike Mozart on Flickr\xc2\xa9 2021 Benzinga.com.
