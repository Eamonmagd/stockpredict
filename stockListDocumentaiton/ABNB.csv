What's great about exploring business and the economy is the insight it gives you into how things are in the world. While I no longer get to exercise my analytical muscles with linguistics it's rewarding to analyze business and share my opinions through this platform.Appreciate my writing have an idea for me or is there an issue with something I wrote? Feel free to reach out to me at jon.quast@foolcontractors.com.Follow @TMFJaguarIf you're bearish on Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock you probably don't like its lack of profits -- the company has never been profitable and it had a staggering $4.6 billion net loss in 2020. Furthermore shares trade at a pricey valuation with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 32.The Airbnb bulls of course have counterarguments for the bears. First they'll point out that many top stocks aren't profitable because they're focusing on growth. Moreover Airbnb stock perhaps looks more pricey than it actually is. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily suppressed travel negatively affecting Airbnb's revenue for 2020 and consequently elevating its P/S ratio. But now with coronavirus vaccinations being distributed the economy is poised for a rebound to Airbnb's benefit.The bears say it's an overvalued cash-burning machine while the bulls say the high price and lack of profits are justified by its growth opportunities. However both arguments are probably overly simplistic. For the record I do believe this is a stock to buy and hold. But there's a nuanced explanation you'll want to consider.Image source: Airbnb.Follow the moneyGrowth investors are understandably comfortable with unprofitable businesses. After all a great business idea might just need scale to become profitable. In those cases it can pay to invest patiently in unprofitable companies anticipating the future cash flows.However you shouldn't invest indiscriminately in unprofitable companies in the name of growth. Some so-called growth stocks won't ever create shareholder value because of how they're built. For this reason we should ask why Airbnb is unprofitable. To answer this we dive into the statements of cash flows -- where's the money going?Most of Airbnb's net loss comes from a non-cash expense: Stock-based compensation. For 2020 the company had over $3 billion in stock-based compensation but this was abnormally high because of its initial public offering (IPO). IPOs cause a one-time spike in compensation because it's recognized all at once rather than gradually.Stock-based compensation isn't an operating expense so we can set it aside for our purposes here. Nevertheless Airbnb had negative cash from operations in 2020 even after adjusting for this non-cash expense. Why?From 2015 through the end of 2019 Airbnb's revenue increased roughly five-fold. During that time most operating expenses increased by about the same rate except one: Product and development (otherwise known as research and development or R&D). Its R&D expenses increased almost 10-fold. And then in 2020 this one line item nearly tripled year over year to almost $2.8 billion.Image source: Getty Images.A potentially rewarding riskAirbnb is quite literally investing its money back into the business and I say that's money well spent. The company estimates its addressable market at $3.4 trillion and I believe Airbnb already has a competitive advantage. Consider that in the first nine months of 2020 only 9% of its users booked because of an ad -- the rest came in by themselves proving this is the top-of-mind player in the space.Consumers know all about Airbnb and used it to book over 193 million nights and experiences on the platform during the past year. And yet in 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) the company only had 54 million active bookers. That's really small for a global company whose product (travel experiences) has almost universal appeal -- the still extreme growth potential was enough to make me reconsider buying this stock.Short-term rental hosts are a different story for Airbnb. With just around four million active hosts the company's putting an outsized portion of that R&D and marketing spend toward recruiting and onboarding more.Keep in mind that Airbnb is in control when it comes to R&D spending. If profits were required now it could have spent just 23% less on this one line item in 2020 and been operating-cash-flow positive. But that's not the goal right now. The short-term rental by owner market is still emerging and companies are jockeying for market share Airbnb included.Herein lies the risk. Airbnb is spending on growth which is smart. But it needs to show a healthy return on this investment. If the company fails to grow its network of hosts meaningfully in 2021 and beyond it could lose its top-of-mind brand status among consumers. This would require it to start spending more heavily on user acquisition in addition to its current spending on the host experience complicating its ability to create shareholder value.How to buy AirbnbIn coming quarters pay attention to growth with Airbnb's hosts. Lackluster progress there would be a reason to question the company's current capital allocation strategy and would be a valid concern for a long-term Airbnb investment.That said Airbnb's top-dog status and massive opportunity make this a stock to buy in my opinion. However IPOs are often volatile in the first year. For that reason this is a good stock with which to use the advantage of dollar-cost averaging building a position slowly over time by making small investments at regular intervals.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Will You Be One of Them?On April 20 at 7 p.m. ET Louis Navellier and Matt McCall will reveal an event that\xe2\x80\x99s about to rock the stock market and how you could use it to beat the markets by nearly 11X.Tue April 20 at 7:00PM ETDaysHoursMinutesSecondsRegister Here FreeHome / Expert Stock Picks to Buy Now / Stocks to Sell / Steer Clear of Overvalued Airbnb StockIt\xe2\x80\x99s truly incredible how far Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock has rallied in such a short time.Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.comAirbnb went public on Dec. 10 at $68. Less than four months later it trades at $182.That\xe2\x80\x99s a cool 167% return in less than four months. Yes a first-day \xe2\x80\x9cpop\xe2\x80\x9d of 112% accounts for a chunk of the gains and most investors couldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy at that $68 price. But even off the first-day close of $145 ABNB stock still has returned more than 25%.It\xe2\x80\x99s a rally that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe makes much sense. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a rally that I believe is driven by short-term factors.When it comes to growth stocks I repeatedly counsel investors to take the long view. Indeed I gave precisely that advice even during the worst of last year\xe2\x80\x99s pandemic-driven selloff.The point of growth investing is to look at where the business will be years from now. It\xe2\x80\x99s not to get caught up in what is happening this year or what multiple the stock might be trading at relative to trailing results. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward.The problem with Airbnb stock is that the future isn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly as bright as this rally and a monstrous valuation suggest. ABNB might be a decent buy at the right price but we\xe2\x80\x99re a long long way from the right price.The Reopening TradeIn 2020 \xe2\x80\x9cpandemic winners\xe2\x80\x9d were all the rage. The buying started with the clear short-term winners like manufacturers of personal protective equipment (PPE). It then moved on to \xe2\x80\x9cwork from home\xe2\x80\x9d names e-commerce companies and other businesses that would actually benefit from the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic.In 2021 most of those stocks have sold off \xe2\x80\x94 because investors see normalcy on the horizon. Vaccines are here hospitalizations are decreasing and a recovery is underway. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what is commonly called \xe2\x80\x9cthe reopening trade.\xe2\x80\x9d Stocks and sectors \xe2\x80\x94 think brick-and-mortar retail or cruise stocks \xe2\x80\x94 that were crushed in 2020 are rebounding this year.At first blush this trading makes sense. And in fact in quite a few cases it does. For instance many pandemic winners weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily just going to see 2020 results improve. They were going to attract customers who would stick around even once normalcy returned.And for some losers 2020 in the grand scheme of things is just a blip. If the business gets back to its pre-pandemic trend the valuation of that business should roughly do the same.ABNB seems a logical winner of the reopening trade. The rally since the initial public offering (IPO) suggests investors see it that way. Travel is going to return \xe2\x80\x94 and maybe in a big way. Airbnb seems set for blowout results in the second half of this year and into 2022.The Long-Term Problem for ABNB StockBut again let\xe2\x80\x99s take the long view.In doing so we see that the pandemic creates a number of significant problems for Airbnb problems that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to end when the pandemic mercifully does.For instance we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing signs of an exodus out of cities. Rents in San Francisco have fallen by one-third.That\xe2\x80\x99s not a good thing for supply. Indeed Airbnb already has pivoted away from urban destinations. But in those markets competition is far more stiff with rivals including not just other online platforms but entrenched local operators.Many of those markets also are seasonal. Tourists visit New York City every time of the year. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case for upstate New York or the Jersey Shore.Indeed Airbnb had to do well simply to avoid significant financial trouble. Give the company credit for the ability to dodge that near-term problem. But at the same time understand that the long-term outlook here is not quite what it was.An Incredible ValuationThat\xe2\x80\x99s a problem at this valuation. Airbnb now has a market capitalization well past $100 billion.In fact if you combine the market caps of the three largest hotel companies and even if you add their debt (to calculate what is known as enterprise value) they\xe2\x80\x99re still worth less than Airbnb is right now.From one perspective that might make some sense. Airbnb actually has more units available for rent with a third-party estimate of some 5.4 million listings.But those listings aren\xe2\x80\x99t hotel rooms. They\xe2\x80\x99re not available 365 days a year. And Airbnb relative to the total price paid (most of which is not accounted for as Airbnb revenue) has lower margins than those hotel chains.In that context the valuation is unsustainable. It suggests that Airbnb will dominate the lodging business to an extent never before seen.Even if you ignore the fact that the hotel chains have a long-running trend of significant profitability while Airbnb currently is posting losses the relative valuation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make much sense. The profits Airbnb will make are in the future and need to be discounted. Yet ABNB stock is priced as if it\xe2\x80\x99s already far and away the market leader.That\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the case. And when investors stop focusing on the strength that may arrive over the next couple of quarters and instead look at the risks that will follow in the ensuing years that price is going to change. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be for the better.On the date of publication neither Matt McCall nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in the article.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to\xe2\x80\xafactually help\xc2\xa0investors \xe2\x80\x94 by getting them into the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.\xc2\xa0Click here to see what Matt has up his sleeve now.Matt McCallEditor MoneyWireMeet Matt McCallWith his next-generation approach to investing Matt McCall finds better stocks for you to invest in \xe2\x80\x94 not the same old companies over-hyped on Wall Street.Learn more about MattArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/04/steer-clear-overvalued-abnb-stock/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCMore from Matt McCallMarket Insight Financial ArticlesDon\xe2\x80\x99t Miss My Favorite Semiconductor StocksBy Matt McCallApr 13 2021UncategorizedThe Chip Stocks You Should Be Keeping an Eye OnBy Matt McCallApr 13 2021Stocks to SellDespite the Rally in Exxon Mobil Stock Continue to Avoid ItBy Matt McCall and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 12 2021ADVERTISEMENTMatt's Most PopularHot StocksDon\xe2\x80\x99t Miss This Chance for Life-Changing Profits With Small High-Growth StocksHot StocksEvery Investor Should Own at Least Some of These StocksHot StocksWhat Square\xe2\x80\x99s $50 Million Bitcoin Investment Means for YouHot StocksThis Bill Gates-Backed Company Is Making Big Waves in the Battery WorldHot Stocks5G Stocks: This New Era of Massive Profits Just BeganContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

The TelegraphFacebook tests video speed dating for \'kind people\'Facebook is experimenting with a video speed-dating app in the hope it can lure a generation of TikTok fans who have grown tired of scrolling through static images while looking for love. The app named Sparked requires a Facebook account to log in. It is the creation of Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s New Product Experimentation team a secretive department focused on testing out apps for Android and Apple that can stand alone from its core Facebook products: WhatsApp Facebook and Instagram. In an apparent dig at Tinder one of the most popular dating apps among young people Sparked says it will not offer public profiles the ability to swipe through pictures of possible courtiers nor send \xe2\x80\x9cendless DMs\xe2\x80\x9d or direct messages. Instead the app will allow people to quickly enter video chats with other users before picking on someone they might like to date. The focus is on meeting \xe2\x80\x9cwith kind people\xe2\x80\x9d its website claimed. It is not clear when - or if - the app will officially launch as it is not currently taking signups. Facebook launched a separate dating service in the UK at the height of the pandemic. Facebook dating allows its existing users to \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d with courtiers and go on virtual dates using Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s video call tool. Those looking for love can build a dating profile using the information Facebook already has stored. A secret crush might be revealed to an admirer if both users have each other on their list. Using the opt-in feature which can be found in the Facebook app potential dates can see whether they have mutual friends and common interests. The switch to video only apps has attracted investor attention in Silicon Valley. Dating websites have long experimented with video but investors now believe that the latest technology and public mood is ready for moving image. Video dating app Snack secured $3.5m in funding this year. Its founder Kim Kaplan who helped build incumbent dating website Plenty Of Fish described Snack as:\xe2\x80\x9cTinder meets TikTok for Generation Z\xe2\x80\x9d.

The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d agoBloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider.

Despite pricing the IPO above the expected range at $68 the stock more than doubled on listing. It continued to rise after the IPO and made a 52-week high of $219.94. Since then the stock has fallen over 18 percent from the peaks. While many investors wonder whether buying the dip in ABNB stock might be a sound investment strategy the stock looks overvalued and will likely drop more.Article continues below advertisementAirbnb and DoorDash went public around the same time in 2020 and delivered stellar listing gains despite the valuation looking stretched even at the IPO price.\xc2\xa0Why Airbnb stock is dropping The strong gains prompted at least two companies Roblox and Affirm to delay their IPOs to 2021 and rework their IPO pricing. Both of these companies went public in 2021 and spiked after listing.Article continues below advertisementSource: TIKRABNB stock priceThere has been a sell-off in growth stocks amid the surge in bond yields. Higher interest rates in the future would make future cash flows less attractive. Investors have been selling companies whose revenues and cash flows are skewed to the future.Article continues below advertisementSecond the rally in reopening stocks went a bit ahead of the fundamentals even though the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage global economic activity. There has been a spike in new COVID-19 cases globally over the last month and reopening stocks like ABNB have come under pressure.Source: AirbnbArticle continues below advertisementABNB stock is overvalued.Meanwhile the biggest reason ABNB stock has dropped is that investors are getting cognizant of its valuations which look a bit too stretched. Airbnb stock trades at an NTM EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 21.8x. The multiple would seem high even for high-growth tech companies.Airbnb has a market capitalization of above $100 billion. Bulls would try to justify the valuation by placing Airbnb alongside start-up tech companies. However over the last few months investors have been getting wary of the \xe2\x80\x9cnew age tech stocks.\xe2\x80\x9dArticle continues below advertisementElectric vehicle stocks have tumbled in 2021 as investors weigh their outlook versus the tech-like valuations. There has been a sharp fall in fintech and health tech stocks. Interestingly old economy stocks like banks and autos have risen even though their \xe2\x80\x9ctech cousins\xe2\x80\x9d have fallen.\xc2\xa0The San Diego City Council voted 8-1 today to legalize short-term rentals and to cap them at 1% of the city's housing stock. Expedia initially negotiated the deal with the Unite Here local at .75%. Airbnb eventually backed the measure when raised to 1%. Law effective 7/1/2022\xe2\x80\x94 Dennis Schaal (@denschaal) April 7 2021Article continues below advertisementClearly markets are now questioning the tech status of many companies and ABNB would form part of that category. Even after valuing ABNB as a growth company it will face several headwinds.\xc2\xa0Challenges Airbnb will likely faceThere has been a backlash in several cities globally about residents renting out their premises on Airbnb. Some cities including New York have already put restrictions on Airbnb and many more might follow. The regulatory arbitrage between hotels and Airbnb properties might also narrow soon.Article continues below advertisementOverall while there isn't any denying that short-term rental companies like Airbnb have revolutionized the hospitality industry ABNB stock looks overvalued even after accounting for all of the positives.Source: AirbnbArticle continues below advertisementABNB stock might drop more.According to the estimates compiled by CNN Business ABNB stock has a median target price of $180 which is similar to its current stock price. The stock\xe2\x80\x99s lowest target price of $130 is 27.8 percent below the current price while the highest target price of $245 is a premium of 36 percent over the next 12 months.I would expect ABNB stock to drop more in 2021 looking at the elevated valuations and the various macro and company-specific challenges it's facing. Like many other overvalued companies Airbnb also capitalized on the rise in its stock and raised $2 billion from convertible notes.AdvertisementMore From Market RealistConsumerWhere Is My Plus-Up Stimulus Payment?ConsumerWhich U.S. Companies Didn't Pay Any Taxes Last Year?ConsumerAltimeter Growth Stock Is a Speculative Play on Grab Merger NewsConsumerThe Latest Pandemic Shortage Weirdly Is KetchupAdvertisementABOUT Market RealistAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCACONNECT with Market RealistDo Not Sell My Personal Information\xc2\xa9 Copyright 2021 Market Realist.

Will You Be One of Them?On April 20 at 7 p.m. ET Louis Navellier and Matt McCall will reveal an event that\xe2\x80\x99s about to rock the stock market and how you could use it to beat the markets by nearly 11X.Tue April 20 at 7:00PM ETDaysHoursMinutesSecondsRegister Here FreeHome / Expert Stock Picks to Buy Now / Hot Stocks / 7 Cyclical Stocks To Bet Against a Recession in the OffingSource: ShutterstockInvestors are getting mixed signals on the state of the economy as we head into spring. On the one hand investor concerns over inflation deficit spending and certain Fed decisions continue to cause worry. Some economists fear that a rebound following the pandemic may not be as robust as previously predicted. Still others are betting that the U.S. economy is entering a period of boom.Among those in the latter camp is Jamie Dimon CEO of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) who wrote in his annual shareholder letter that \xe2\x80\x9cstrong consumer savings expanded vaccine distribution and the Biden administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan could lead to an economic \xe2\x80\x9cGoldilocks moment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 fast sustained growth alongside inflation and interest rates that drift slowly upward.\xe2\x80\x9dThus investors who adhere to Dimon\xe2\x80\x99s logic should naturally gravitate toward cyclical stocks. That\xe2\x80\x99s because cyclical stocks correlate strongly with the cycles of the economy.Investors betting on an American economic boom should consider these cyclical stocks:Nike (NYSE:NKE)McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE:MCD)Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX)Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL)Cyclical Stocks: Nike (NKE)Source: Square Box Photos / Shutterstock.comCyclical stocks correlate with discretionary spending. In stronger economic times consumers spend more of their respective budgets on discretionary items such as apparel. This is very likely to lead to a boon for Nike.The argument in favor of NKE stock being a strong bet against a recession is clear: Consumers will go out and buy Nike shoes and apparel as their confidence in the economy improves.There is a good argument to be made that Nike should experience a real boost in its North America business. The company\xe2\x80\x99s revenues have held quite steady over the course of the pandemic across its overall business. The business is divided into four divisions \xe2\x80\x94 North America EMEA (Europe Middle East & Africa) Greater China and Asia Pacific & Latin America.In the nine months that ended Feb. 29 2020 Nike recorded $31.09 billion in revenues worldwide. In the same period which ended Feb. 28 2021 the company recorded $32.19 billion in revenues a 4% increase.However Nike\xe2\x80\x99s Greater China division was largely responsible for the positive results. Revenues grew 26% there. Sales dipped or remained flat elsewhere. North America saw a 4% decrease during the period.This should change as consumers head out and buy Nike shoes apparel and equipment in a growing economy.McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comMcDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is a cyclical stock because it sits within the restaurant sector. The headwinds the company has faced in 2020 are obvious: The pandemic has significantly reduced traffic. More people are working home so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t stopping by McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s drive-throughs in the morning. Restrictions on restaurant entry are another issue the company has faced.That\xe2\x80\x99s shown in the numbers. Revenues at company-operated locations decreased by 14% while franchised restaurant revenues dropped by 8%. Total revenues decreased by 10% during 2020. The knock-on issues that affected operations led to net income decreasing by 21% throughout 2021.But as the U.S. bounces out of the pandemic there are strong tailwinds in McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s favor. As a cyclical restaurant stock it is in position to rise. Further as more and more people receive vaccines and life normalizes McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is sure to see an increase in business.Target prices are higher than current prices which is a good signal for investors. Further analysts consider MCD stock to be overweight.Walt Disney (DIS)Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comDisney makes a lot of sense right now. Consumers are itching for entertainment and one of the places they will return to is Walt Disney parks. Consumers visit Disney parks more often in economic boom times under normal circumstances. These however are not normal circumstances.That\xe2\x80\x99s actually a good thing for Disney because its parks suffered greatly during the pandemic. The result of an economic boom like Jamie Dimon predicts along with lifted sanctions is a real multiplier for DIS stock.Disneyland Resort in California is opening its Avengers campus in early June which should only serve to boost the company. But the overall thrust is that families are going to flood in for multiple reasons under an economic boom.Disney won\xe2\x80\x99t release earnings again until May 13 but investors should still note that the company performed well during the pandemic. The company has seen its parks segment get pummeled. Through the quarter that ended Jan. 2 parks recorded an operating loss of $119 million. During the same period in the year prior parks recorded operating income of $2.52 billion. Yet DIS stock was bolstered by the performance of other assets. including Disney+ which saw rapid growth.So a booming economy makes DIS stock a strong bet.Airbnb (ABNB)Source: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.comThe hotels and lodging industry is one that always suffers during a weak economy. People don\xe2\x80\x99t travel as often as purse strings tighten thus revenues decline. The opposite is true in strong economic times of course.Investors are already well-aware of this phenomenon. In the recent pivot into cyclical stocks they\xe2\x80\x99ve run up the prices of some lodging stocks; Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) sits close to pre-pandemic prices Wyndham Hotels (NYSE:WH) as well.Wall Street remains hesitant on ABNB stock. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a case to be made that it really makes a lot of sense. Gross bookings declined to $23.5 billion in 2020 from $38 billion in 2019. They will of course rebound due to vaccine distribution and the lifting of sanctions. This will lead to an increase in bookings which will naturally increase in a strong economy. Again somewhat of a compounding of tailwinds.ABNB was a contentious stock when it had its initial public offering in December. Investors have wondered what to make of its investment case ever since. The pandemic compounds the difficulty. Nevertheless it is a good bet against a recession.TJX Companies (TJX)Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies includes names like TJ Maxx Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Home Goods and Sierra. TJX stock is a strong bet against a recession because apparel and home fashion are strong cyclical sector components.A strong economy is one which is reopened. For TJX that is an improving situation. Throughout 2020 TJX saw closures across all of its stores during 24% of store days. During the fourth quarter that number decreased to 13% so the company is headed in the right direction. And the theory goes that an opened economy is going to be a booming one so TJX stock benefits as a discretionary cyclical stock.TJX stores which have remained open didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a massive decline during the pandemic. In the latest quarter such stores only lost 3% in sales; in the entire year 4%. Those figures become much worse in consideration of the aforementioned closures. In the latest quarter sales are down 10.35%. On the year nearly 23%.TJX stock is a strong bet that a recession does not occur. As a result consumers should bolster it by increasing discretionary spending on clothing and home goods.Lululemon Athletica (LULU)Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.comLULU stock benefits from a similar narrative to that for Nike. Sporting apparel booms along with economies. In Lululemon\xe2\x80\x99s case the company is already doing well. During the most recent quarter revenues increased 24% to $1.7 billion. While revenues increased a strong 21% in North America they rose a much sharper 47% internationally.And the company performed strongly throughout the worst of the pandemic as well. Revenue increased 11% in 2020. The company witnessed an 8% revenue increase in North America and 31% internationally.Lululemon\xe2\x80\x99s management gave strong guidance in its recent earnings report: \xe2\x80\x9cFor fiscal 2021 we expect net revenue to be in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.25 for the year and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45.\xe2\x80\x9dThe company is doing very well and should trend upward if and when a strong economy emerges.Delta Airlines (DAL)Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comThere has been a rush into airline stocks over the past six weeks. As a result the strongest performers in the sector are already bid up. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) if that weren\xe2\x80\x99t the case. But the fact is LUV stock is above where it was trading prior to the pandemic. That means investors think it is now more valuable even though the pandemic crushed its revenues. The logic seems flawed to me.Nevertheless airlines are a strong cyclical bet against a recession. People will be travelling in droves in a stronger economy.Being that that is the case Delta Airlines\xc2\xa0makes sense right now. DAL stock is 15% below pre-pandemic trading prices as I write this. The company got crushed just as Southwest did.But it was making strides forward in improving its service and business structure before the pandemic sent the entire industry into a tailspin.Delta\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled capacity is still down 35% in Q1 2021 and total revenues are anticipated to be down 60-65% in the same period. But the company will pop up in a strong economy because a strong economy will be an open one.On the date of publication Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Alex Sirois is a freelance contributor to InvestorPlace whose personal stock investing style is focused on long-term buy-and-hold wealth-building stock picks.\xc2\xa0Having worked in several industries from e-commerce to translation to education and utilizing his MBA from George Washington University he brings a diverse set of skills through which he filters his writing.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/7-cyclical-stocks-to-bet-against-a-recession-in-the-offing/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

U.S. IPO of 2020By Noor Zainab Hussain Joshua Franklin(Reuters) -Shares of Airbnb Inc more than doubled in their stock market debut on Thursday valuing the home rental firm at just over $100 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of 2020 and capping a bumper year in which investors flocked to tech stocks.Airbnb opened at $146 on the Nasdaq far above the IPO price of $68 per share that raised $3.5 billion for the company. The stock hit a high of $165 and closed at $144.71.The IPO is the culmination of a stunning recovery in Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes after the firm\xe2\x80\x99s business was heavily damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.But as lockdowns eased more travelers opted to book homes instead of hotels helping Airbnb post a surprise profit for the third quarter. The San Francisco-based firm also gained from increased interest in renting homes away from major cities.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this summer too many people expected to see an Airbnb IPO this year\xe2\x80\x9d Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky told Reuters in an interview.\xe2\x80\x9cWe were planning on going public we put our IPO on hold and this has been the most unbelievable journey. It\xe2\x80\x99s been quite a comeback for our hosts and for what I hope will be travel\xe2\x80\x9d added Chesky whose Airbnb stake is now worth around $11 billion.Founded in 2008 as a website to take bookings for rooms during conferences Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s listing was one of the most anticipated U.S. IPOs of 2020 which has already been a record year for stock market listings.Record label Warner Music Group data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and data warehouse company Snowflake Inc have all gone public in the past few months.At the start of trading on the Nasdaq Airbnb had a market capitalization of $86.5 billion eclipsing that of online travel agency Booking Holdings Inc and hotel chain Marriott International Inc.Including securities such as options and restricted stock units Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s fully diluted valuation came to $100.7 billion more than five times the $18 billion Airbnb was valued at in a private fundraising round in April at the outset of the pandemic. Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s worth was pegged at $31 billion in its last pre-COVID-19 private fundraising in 2017.The eye-popping rise in Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s stock on its debut comes just a day after the share price of food delivery company DoorDash Inc doubled in their first day of trading.Such large first-day trading gains are likely to fuel criticism from some venture capital investors including Benchmark\xe2\x80\x99s Bill Gurley who argue investment banks underprice IPOs so their investor clients can score large gains when the stock starts trading. Such advocates have pushed for companies to consider listing shares through a direct listing in which bankers have little influence on the price at which stock is sold.Chesky said Airbnb would focus on the things that were within the company\xe2\x80\x99s control.\xe2\x80\x9cAt this point the price of stock is not something we control. I\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged our employees to focus on things they can control\xe2\x80\x9d Chesky said speaking before the stock had started trading.Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Joshua Franklin in MiamiEditing by Anil D\xe2\x80\x99Silva and Matthew LewisAIRBNB Stock \xe2\x80\x93 Airbnb valuation surges past $100 billion in biggest U.S. IPO of 2020Tags: AIRBNB StockStock Market LatestNews on C N N.Tags: AirbnbBroker Research / RecommendationsCompany NewsContent produced in BangaloreDealsEquities MarketsEquity Capital ChangesInitial Public OfferingsipoLeisure & Recreation (TRBC level 4)Major NewsOnline Services (NEC) (TRBC level 5)Private Equity (TRBC level 5)Reuters Top NewsSecondary Share Offerings / IssuesTechnology (TRBC level 1)Travel Agents (TRBC level 5)United StatesPrevious PostAmazon Stock \xe2\x80\x93 Cooling Bamboo Queen Size Comforter Bed Sets Debut on AmazonNext PostBiontech Stock \xe2\x80\x93 BCTX Stock: Over 10% Increase Pre-Market Explanation \xe2\x80\x93 News BreakAlex LoweAlex is a financial writer covering forex.

Will You Be One of Them?On April 20 at 7 p.m. ET Louis Navellier and Matt McCall will reveal an event that\xe2\x80\x99s about to rock the stock market and how you could use it to beat the markets by nearly 11X.Tue April 20 at 7:00PM ETDaysHoursMinutesSecondsRegister Here FreeHome / Alternative & Private Investing / Upcoming IPOs & SPACs to Buy Now / PSTH Stock Shows the SPAC Bubble Has Further to DeflateIt\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly clear that the boom in SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) turned into a bubble. The question for SPACs like Pershing Square Tontine (NYSE:PSTH) stock is how much further the bubble has to deflate.Source: Dmitry Demidovich/ShutterStock.comBy the standards of the group PSTH stock actually has held up well. A current price at about $25 represents a healthy premium to its $20 redemption price. According to Bloomberg some $81 billion worth of SPACs now trade below their redemption price (usually $10 per share).That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily good news however. PSTH still assumes a substantial amount of equity value will be created whenever Pershing Square Tontine finally finds a merger target. That itself shows that the core belief that created the SPAC bubble still exists \xe2\x80\x94 which in turn suggests that the bubble isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite done inflating.The Math Problem Still HoldsBack in February I walked through the detailed math surrounding PSTH stock.7 Restaurant Stocks Worth a VisitThere are warrants \xe2\x80\x94 some of which admittedly will be issued to PSTH shareholders once the merger closes \xe2\x80\x94 and a forward purchase agreement for potentially $1 billion in new units (shares plus warrants for a total price of $20 each).When you account for that dilution there should be 333.2 million shares outstanding including the original 200 million shares plus warrants plus the forward purchase agreement. Including cash generated from warrant exercises those shares cover a cash hoard of about $6.9 billion.This structure actually is far better than most SPACs. The standard structure often sees 20% of the SPAC\xe2\x80\x99s shares granted to the sponsor for minimal consideration (often $25000). In this case the sponsor \xe2\x80\x94 an affiliate of Pershing Square Capital run by Bill Ackman \xe2\x80\x94 gets nearly 6% ownership in the post-merger company via warrants exercisable at $24 three years after the merger closes. (PSTH directors get another 0.26% on the same terms.)So ostensibly Ackman and Pershing Square get nothing if the merger does not perform well in the long term.Still even disregarding those warrants PSTH has about $20.74 per share in cash. It\xe2\x80\x99s now just below $25. The market still is acting as if Pershing Square will create roughly $1.5 billion in equity value in its deal \xe2\x80\x94 simply to support the current PSTH stock price.First Is BetterThat\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy task. Investors forgot that in bidding up so many pre-merger SPACs well past their redemption price. In retrospect it was Churchill Capital IV (NYSE:CCIV) that highlighted the insanity as CCIV stock moved near $60 even before the details of its merger with Lucid Motors were confirmed.The problem now is that there are simply so many SPACs out there. Three hundred went public in the first quarter alone. And with a couple of hundred mergers agreed to and/or closed the potential supply of SPAC targets has diminished.This is a particularly big problem for Pershing Square Tontine simply given its size. It\xe2\x80\x99s far and away the largest SPAC ever.Ackman has said among his targets would be \xe2\x80\x9cmature unicorns.\xe2\x80\x9d But several companies fitting that description already have gone public: Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) (which reportedly turned Ackman down) DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.What targets remain will have leverage with PSTH. They can negotiate better terms with one of the hundreds of SPACs also looking for a deal. Or they can go the initial public offering route.Expecting $2 billion in value creation \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum really needed to own PSTH even after the pullback \xe2\x80\x94 seems awfully aggressive in that context.The need for significant value creation still is a problem for SPACs more broadly owing to the substantial dilution created by founder shares. For PSTH the combination of the premium to the cash hoard and the sheer size creates its own issue.Why PSTH Stock?And that gets to another core problem here: why are investors so excited about betting on Ackman?Ackman\xe2\x80\x99s track record in the market admittedly is impressive. But again consider PSTH\xe2\x80\x99s size and potential targets.The value that Ackman and PSTH create isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming from deep-dive fundamental analysis or finding an unloved business with unlocked potential. Again there aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many businesses left in the SPAC\xe2\x80\x99s potential universe.As a result PSTH\xe2\x80\x99s promise comes down to its ability to negotiate. Do we have much evidence that Ackman and his advisors will be or can be that savvy?Nor does Ackman have much in the way of operational experience. Ackman famously took an activist position in Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) a few years back which led to the departure of P&G\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive officer. But PG stock remained dead money for years after that before finally rallying in 2019.The story SPAC sponsors like to tell is that the role of the sponsor itself has real value and can help guide the target toward prosperity. We have little evidence Ackman and PSTH can provide that kind of value to the \xe2\x80\x9cmature unicorns\xe2\x80\x9d or family-controlled businesses Ackman says he is targeting.The SPAC ProblemAnd so PSTH shows that investors still haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite grasped the fact that the SPAC trend really didn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense.The vehicles have a spotty long-term track record. The explosion in capital raise created a serious imbalance of supply and demand. And the likes of Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Clover Health (NYSE:CLOV) show that sponsors either don\xe2\x80\x99t always do proper due diligence or don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to share that due diligence with minority investors.There\xe2\x80\x99s a case for PSTH stock to trade for a modest premium given the value of the tontine warrants. But $1.5 billion over the redemption price and $1.2 billion above the value of the cash in the pot is not a modest premium. PSTH stock probably has further to fall and it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that SPACs as a whole do as well.On the date of publication Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/psth-stock-shows-spac-bubble-further-deflate/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.
