Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h agoBenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2NeckRelaxWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdSkip The Chiropractor & Reduce Neck& Shoulder PainThanks to its compact and ingenious design I can use the NeckRelax practically anywhere. BloombergArgentina\xe2\x80\x99s Peso Mess Is Delivering Windfall Profits to Brokers(Bloomberg) -- In Argentina financial markets are all but dead. From stocks to bonds to traditional foreign-exchange venues trading volumes are razor thin after the government slapped on rigid currency restrictions in the lead up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s debt default.Except that is in one unusual corner of markets. There brokerages are doing a bustling business -- and raking in record profits -- by handling the types of arcane transactions that Argentines use to convert pesos into dollars and circumvent the limits the government placed on obtaining foreign currencies. At least five firms reported income surges of 500% or more last year with one of them a large shop called Allaria Ledesma posting a 2200% increase.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going through a boom\xe2\x80\x9d said Julio Merlini the chief executive officer of Balanz Capital which has doubled its client base and boosted its workforce by more than half since the controls were imposed in 2019. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople stopped investing in mutual funds and timed deposits and are dollarizing portfolios.\xe2\x80\x9dBut as Argentines eschew traditional investments to focus on converting their assets to dollars before the peso weakens even further banks are forbidden from operating in the so-called blue-chip swap markets used to get foreign currency. That helped lead the sector to its worst performance in 13 years. A steady stream of bankers have left to join brokerages since the restrictions were put in place in 2019 with Merlini estimating they can earn about 50% more in their new jobs.It\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the fallout from former President Mauricio Macri\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose capital controls amid a rush for the doors after the political opposition won a key primary in 2019. The move left foreign investors with no easy way to get their money out of the country and crimped the ability of Argentines to buy dollars leaving them to either watch the value of their peso savings tumble amid rampant inflation or seek an escape in the blue-chip swap.Called the contado con liquidacion in Spanish the swap has been around for almost two decades in Argentina with use peaking when restrictions are dialed up and the peso\xe2\x80\x99s prospects deteriorate. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually undertaken by buying peso assets locally and then selling them abroad for dollars creating an exchange rate that\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 38% weaker than the official one.It\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of parallel rates that have taken hold in Argentina amid the economic turmoil of the past few years. The country has been rocked by a 60% drop for the peso since the end of 2018 a $60 billion default by the federal government and the worst economic collapse since 2002 last year amid one of the region\xe2\x80\x99s strictest pandemic lockdowns.As the blue-chip swap took off more typical financial transactions have seen reduced volumes. Financial entities traded a daily average of $167 million in the spot foreign-exchange market last year down 67% from a year earlier. Fixed-income volume in the Mercado Abierto Electronico which is owned by banks fell by more than half to $96 billion.At the Argentine Stock Exchange mostly the domain of brokers fixed-income volumes jumped 57% in 2020 to $247 billion.The shifts have propelled a surge in bank departures as investment professionals seek out higher wages and less regulatory scrutiny. At least a dozen prominent bankers have made the switch since mid-2019 including HSBC Plc trader Juan Manuel Truppia\xe2\x80\x99s jump to TPCG Valores. Other high-profile moves include Manuel Rocha-Nan\xe2\x80\x99s switch from head of corporate sales at Banco Galicia to Max Capital and Carolina Gialdi a fixed-income strategist at BTG Pactual who also joined Max Capital.\xe2\x80\x9cThe brokers today are fed by the banks\xe2\x80\x9d said Juan Rodriguez Braun a partner at Max Capital which increased its workforce by 25% in 2020 to 50 employees.

A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Life Insurance CoverWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdBrits Rush To Take Out Up To \xc2\xa3291k Life Insurance*Cheaper life insurance policies are available now.

The first he says is how consumers behaved last year during the height of shutdowns."We saw it last summer you\'re going to see it again this year too. People want to get out people are going to take a vacation" he said.His second point is that the industry will just adapt. Instead of resorts and airports people will prioritize home rentals and road trips. \xc2\xa0Lastly any slowdown this year will be made up for in coming years he says."Whether the vaccine distribution is delayed in the short term or not it doesn\'t really derail what we\'re expecting in the 2022 and 2023 time-frame timeline. Bottom line we\'re looking for a full recovery pretty quick a lot of pent-up demand" said Fuller.Still the industry is not without its risks. Other than any resurgence in Covid cases Fuller says online travel bookings may succumb to the natural business cycle."It\'s a maturing business. So once we get through the recovery phase I think you\'re looking at online travel growth looking a lot more like the underlying travel industry say 3 4 5 6%. It\'s no longer a 10% to 15% growth industry and that probably keeps a lid on valuations moving forward" he said.BTIG has a neutral rating on Booking TripAdvisor and Airbnb. The firm has a buy rating and $180 price target on Expedia though based on bullish market share projections. Expedia\'s stock closed Tuesday\'s trading at $51.69 and is up 29% this year.VIDEO6:1906:19Vaccines and the travel trade: What to expect after J&J pauseCNBCDisclaimerWhy one trader is \'cautious\' on the Coinbase debut as bitcoin hits all-time highLizzy GurdusHigh valuations and Covid risks put market in fragile position ahead of Q1 earnings PNC warnsStephanie LandsmanThis is the \xe2\x80\x98sword of Damocles\xe2\x80\x99 hanging over small-cap stocks trader saysKeris LahiffRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar with this company Uber provides a ridesharing application that offers a quick and convenient way to help people get from point A to point B and has essentially deemed taxis obsolete. Those that have spent time in taxis before are probably are familiar with their shortcomings. Flagging down a taxi can be difficult especially during rush hour traffic or if you are in an obscure location. Taxi drivers often complain about short-distance trips and charge their customers by the mile which means that unlike Uber riders don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much they will pay until the end of the trip. Now people in need of a ride can simply connect with a driver on Uber\xe2\x80\x99s application in minutes and hit the road. It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Uber Technologies is a unique business that created a truly revolutionary transportation platform and there are several compelling reasons to consider adding shares at this time. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a deeper look below. Record Demand for March 2021 One of the main causes for concern about Uber over the last year is the fact that the pandemic has put a major dent in the company\xe2\x80\x99s ridesharing volumes. With people prioritizing social distancing and safety for the majority of 2020 Uber\xe2\x80\x99s earnings saw major declines. The company\xe2\x80\x99s trips were down 27% year-over-year in 2020 which ended up being a drag on revenue and EBITDA. However as more people get vaccinated and the world starts to reopen there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Uber trip volumes rebounding in 2021 and beyond. We are already seeing some encouraging signs that a recovery is on the cards. This week Uber announced that it had the highest total gross bookings in March 2021 in a single month since the company started back in 2009. The company is also spending $250 million on bonuses to boost the number of drivers that are available in the short term. In Uber\xe2\x80\x99s Q4 earnings report gross bookings grew 16% quarter-over-quarter to $17.2 billion which could be another sign of good things to come. The bottom line here is that Uber is poised to rebound sharply as the pandemic subsides which is a strong bull case for owning the stock. Surging Uber Eats Business Another strong reason to consider adding shares of Uber at this time is the fact that its Uber Eats business has been thriving and will likely be a growth driver for many years to come. As a reminder Uber Eats is an application that offers contactless deliveries for restaurant takeout groceries and more. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit ironic that one side of the company\xe2\x80\x99s business model was hurt badly by the pandemic while the other side saw huge growth but just imagine this company\xe2\x80\x99s potential when both Uber Eats and its ridesharing platform are firing on all cylinders. Uber Eats posted record monthly bookings in March and the company\xe2\x80\x99s recent acquisitions of Postmates and Drizly should be viewed as a statement of intent to become the leader in delivery services. What\xe2\x80\x99s great about Uber Eats is that everyone who has downloaded the Uber ridesharing application has immediate access to food delivery services. Delivery revenues were up 224% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in Q4 2020 and if the company can grow its grocery and alcohol delivery volumes there\xe2\x80\x99s even more upside for this business segment. Strongest Brand in Ridesharing When it comes to owning a ridesharing company why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to own the most recognizable name in the industry? Sure there are competitors out there that could take some of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s market share in the future but the truth is that when people think of ridesharing they think of Uber. There\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said about owning a strong brand name for the long term and this company fits the bill. Uber currently operates in over 63 countries with over 110 million users that order rides or foods at least once per month. The company\xe2\x80\x99s biggest competitor Lyft only has about 32% of the U.S. market share compared to Uber\xe2\x80\x99s 68% based on February 2021 sales. It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that very few customers use both Uber and Lyft which tells us that the company\xe2\x80\x99s market share should remain strong for years to come.Featured Article:Dual ListingMore from EntrepreneurOur Franchise Advisors are here to help you throughout the entire process of building your franchise organization!Schedule a FREE one-on-one session with a Franchise AdvisorChoose one of our programs that matches your needs budget and timelineLaunch your new franchise organizationLearn MoreMake sure you\xe2\x80\x99re covered if an employee gets injured at work byProviding us with basic information about your businessVerifying details about your business with one of our specialistsSpeaking with an agent who is specifically suited to insure your businessGet A QuoteUse code CAREER2021 through 4/17/21 to save on our collection of recommended career books including:Career RehabEntrepreneur Voices on CareersThe New Employee ManualAnd moreSave TodayLatest on EntrepreneurCompanyAdvertiseBrand LicensingHelp CenterEntrepreneur Media DepartmentsStaffContributeReprints & LicensingProductsFranchisePodcastsPublish Your BookEntrepreneur MerchandiseEditionsUnited StatesIndiaAsia PacificMiddle EastEuropeEspa\xc3\xb1olGeorgiaSouth AfricaGet the MagazineJoin Our NewsletterI understand that the data I am submitting will be used to provide me with the above-described products and/or services and communications in connection therewith.I confirm that I am over the age of 16 and consent the above-described data and its use by Entrepreneur Media Inc.SubmitTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCookies PolicyHelp CenterSite MapCopyright \xc2\xa9 2021 Entrepreneur Media Inc.
