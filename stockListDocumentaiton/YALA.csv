As a technical indicator it focuses on recent trends as opposed to the long term health of the underlying company. Updates for the company such as a earnings release can move the stock away from current trends.Changes in price are generally the best indicator of sentiment for a particular stock. At its core a stock's trend indicates whether current market sentiment is bullish or bearish. Investors must be bullish if a stock is trending upward and are bearish if a stock is moving down.InvestorsObserver's Sentiment Indicator factors in both price changes and variations in volume. An increase in volume usually means a current trend is stengthening while a drop in volume tends to signal a reversal to the ongoing trend.Our system also uses the options market in order to receive additional signals on current sentiments. We take into account the ratio of calls and puts for a stock since options allow an investor to bet on future changes in price.What's Happening With YALA Stock Today?Yalla Group Ltd - ADR (YALA) stock is up 2.49% while the S&P 500 has fallen -0.11% as of 10:25 AM on Monday Apr 12.

Serial Haydock winner and third in Cheltenham Gold Cup last year. Respected although may be better suited by softer ground and no top weight has won since Aintree legend Red Rum in the 1970s. Trainer won the Grand National with Earth Summit in 1998 and Bindaree four years later. Jockey triumphed on Neptune Collonges in 2012.Rating: 7/10 Odds: 20-12. CHRIS\'S DREAM Trainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Darragh O\'KeeffeForm: 10-25P Age: 9 Weight: 11-7It was a dream Cheltenham Festival for the trainer who became the first to win jump racing\'s \'Holy Trinity\' at one meeting - the Champion Chase Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup. Chris\'s Dream won the Red Mills Chase last season but was pulled up in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham in March. Stable jockey has opted to ride Minella Times instead.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 40-13. YALA ENKI Trainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Bryony FrostForm: -2F314 Age: 11 Weight: 11-3Jockey who was fifth on Milansbar in 2018 is one of three aiming to become the first woman to ride the winner. Trainer has been keen to run and considers him an ideal type for the National but had to persuade the owners. Fell at the first in the Becher Chase over the National fences although jumped round enthusiastically on his own. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 33-14. BALLYOPTIC Trainer: Nigel Twiston-Davies Jockey: Sam Twiston-DaviesForm: 1-P067 Age: 11 Weight: 11-01Went down by the shortest possible distance - a nose - to Joe Farrell in the 2018 Scottish National at Ayr. Fell on his first try over the National fences in the Becher Chase then was a creditable sixth in the Welsh National but fell again in the 2019 Grand National. Son rides for father who has twice trained the winner.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 40-15. DEFINITLY RED Trainer: Brian Ellison Jockey: Ryan ManiaForm: 21-8F4 Age: 12 Weight: 11-01Likely to be a popular choice with the red half of Merseyside. Sent off a 10-1 shot for the race four years ago but chance went when badly hampered at Becher\'s Brook. In case you wondered - there\'s no E in this Definitly because of a spelling mistake when the horse\'s original registration forms were completed. Ryan Mania who won on Auroras Encore in 2013 gets a late call to replace the injured Henry Brooke.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 40-16. LAKE VIEW LAD Trainer: Nick Alexander Jockey: Brian HughesForm: 33-155 Age: 11 Weight: 11-00 Champion jockey rides Scottish-trained previous winner of Rehearsal Chase and Rowland Meyrick Chase. Owner Trevor Hemmings seeks record fourth National win after triumphs with Hedgehunter (2005) Ballabriggs (2011) and Many Clouds (2015). His main hope appears to be Cloth Cap and it is thought quick ground may be against Lake View Lad.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 25-17. BURROWS SAINTTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Patrick MullinsForm: 31-262 Age: 8 Weight: 10-13 Former top jockey Ruby Walsh thought Burrows Saint had "English National written all over" after winning the Irish National on him in 2019. Had been well fancied for last year\'s Aintree race before it was called off because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Drying ground should help. Trainer triumphed with Hedgehunter in 2005.Rating: 9/10 Odds: 9-18. MAGIC OF LIGHTTrainer: Jessica Harrington (IRE) Jockey: Robbie PowerForm: 8-4128 Age: 10 Weight: 10-13Second to Tiger Roll in 2019 when a 66-1 shot and was first Grand National runner for a trainer who has won the Champion Chase and Cheltenham Gold Cup. Won three times since but carries 5lb more this time and no mare has prevailed since Nickel Coin in 1951. Jockey Robbie \'Puppy\' Power won the National in 2007 on Silver Birch.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 20-19. ACAPELLA BOURGEOIS Trainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Danny MullinsForm: 61-251 Age: 11 Weight: 10-12 On paper a win last time in Bobbyjo Chase reads well - conceding weight and beating Burrows Saint although his stablemate\'s main target has always been this race. Can get excited so absence of spectators may help as should the drying ground. Trainer has twice saddled the runner-up as well as landing the race with Hedgehunter 16 years ago.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 25-110. TALKISCHEAP Trainer: Alan King Jockey: Tom CannonForm: /3P-30 Age: 9 Weight: 10-12Trainer is not a big fan of the Grand National which probably has not been helped by a largely disappointing record in the race. This one hasn\'t done much talking on the track lately but was an impressive winner of the Bet365 Gold Cup (formerly the Whitbread) at Sandown two years ago and would be in the mix on that form.Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-111. TOUT EST PERMISTrainer: Noel Meade (IRE) Jockey: Sean FlanaganForm: 359P4F Age: 8 Weight: 10-12 Fifteen races since his last win. Those defeats include finishing eighth in the 2019 Irish National and falling when evens favourite last time out. Has been well beaten by some of his rivals in this race including Burrows Saint Jett and Chris\'s Dream. Trainer\'s best finish is sixth although did score with 80-1 outsider Jeff Kidder at last month\'s Cheltenham Festival.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 66-112. ANIBALE FLYTrainer: Tony Martin (IRE) Jockey: Denis O\'ReganForm: 9883-5 Age: 11 Weight: 10-12 Beaten by a total of 250 lengths in his past five races but could fly high again after dropping down the weights - saddled with 12lb less this time than when fifth in the 2019 National having finished fourth the year before. Also boasts a second and third place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup so a player if shrewd trainer has him back to form. Rating: 8/10 Odds: 33-113. MISTER MALARKYTrainer: Colin Tizzard Jockey: Jonjo O\'Neill JrForm: -6U173 Age: 8 Weight: 10-12Generally sound jumper and one of the more interesting outsiders if he takes to this Aintree lark. Would be a poignant winner for the trainer whose daughter Kim died 43 from cancer last May. He intends to hand over the training licence to son Joe at the end of this month. Jockey is the son of Jonjo O\'Neill who trains favourite Cloth Cap.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 40-1 14. KIMBERLITE CANDYTrainer: Tom Lacey Jockey: Richie McLernonForm: P/21-2 Age: 9 Weight: 10-10Looked a real National prospect when a comfortable winner of the Classic Chase at Warwick. Like many of us Kimberlite Candy gets a bit grumpy when he\'s taken out of his routine. He\'s sweet enough on this course however - twice finishing runner-up in the Becher Chase over the National fences. Jockey was beaten by a nose on Sunnyhillboy in 2012.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 10-115. ANY SECOND NOW Trainer: Ted Walsh (IRE) Jockey: Mark WalshForm: 1-99P1 Age: 9 Weight: 10-09Planned runner last year before the cancellation and one of several contenders in the green and gold colours of owner JP McManus. Took the Kim Muir Chase at Cheltenham in 2019 before falling in the Irish National. Showed wellbeing with win at Navan in February. Trainer won in 2000 with Papillon ridden by his son Ruby and was third nine years ago with Seabass ridden by daughter Katie who is now his assistant trainer.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 10-116. BALKO DES FLOS Trainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Aidan ColemanForm: -4764U Age: 10 Weight: 10-09Won the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham in 2018 but form has tailed off since then and unseated rider at Cheltenham last month. Bought recently for \xc2\xa3110000 by the new Racehorse Club syndicate which is offering \'micro shares\' at a one-off cost of \xc2\xa375 - that gets you a 0.002% interest. Stable jockey Rachael Blackmore prefers Minella Times.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 40-117. ALPHA DES OBEAUX Trainer: Denise Foster (IRE) Jockey: Jody McGarveyForm: 595PP4 Age: 11 Weight: 10-09Looked in decent shape when ridden in the National three years ago by Rachael Blackmore for previous trainer Mouse Morris before falling at the Chair. Did win a race later that year but has not scored since. Stayed on to finish fourth in the Cross Country Chase behind winner Tiger Roll at Cheltenham last month. First ride in the race for jockey who looks to be going places.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 66-118. OK CORRAL Trainer: Nicky Henderson Jockey: Derek O\'Connor Form: /091-P Age: 11 Weight: 10-08There\'s something inexplicable about the record of trainer Nicky Henderson who has won multiple Champion Hurdles Champion Chases and Gold Cups but has an unenviable record in the Grand National. Nine of his runners have fallen at the first fences and it is more in hope than expectation that he seeks a first win. Despite being aged 11 OK Corral is still well placed for a shootout - lightly raced and booking of leading Irish amateur jockey is a plus.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 40-119. TAKINGRISKSTrainer: Nicky Richards Jockey: Sean QuinlanForm: 65-P41 Age: 12 Weight: 10-07 "He doesn\'t perform like an old-age pensioner does he?" said trainer Nicky Richards after the veteran Takingrisks won at Doncaster in January. The last 12-year-old to win the Grand National was Amberleigh House 17 years ago. But the peak form of a Scottish Grand National win in 2019 when beating Cloth Cap makes this a less risky proposition. Trainer\'s father Gordon won with Lucius (1978) and Hallo Dandy (1984).Rating: 7/10 Odds: 33-120. SHATTERED LOVETrainer: Denise Foster (IRE) Jockey: Kevin SextonForm: -31023 Age: 10 Weight: 10-07Decent third in the mares\' chase at the Cheltenham Festival although backers must be prepared to have their hearts broken in this tougher test. Never fallen in 23 races over fences and won seven of them including the JLT Novices\' Chase at the Festival in 2018 but was pulled up when tried in the Irish Grand National a year later.Rating: 7/10 Odds: 40-121. JETTTrainer: Jessica Harrington (IRE) Jockey: Sam Waley-CohenForm: P78P06 Age: 10 Weight: 10-07Trailed in eighth in the Becher Chase over the National fences earlier in the season although jumped fine - and the ground was softer than ideal for him then. Trainer also has Magic Of Light who was second in 2019. Amateur jockey riding for father Robert won the Cheltenham Gold Cup 10 years ago on Long Run and has triumphed six times over the National fences in other races at the meeting.Rating: 7/10 Odds: 50-122. LORD DU MESNILTrainer: Richard Hobson Jockey: Nick ScholfieldForm: 2-4991 Age: 8 Weight: 10-06 Won the Grand National Trial at Haydock in February and was second in the National Hunt Chase at last year\'s Cheltenham Festival. Seems to need soft ground to really lord it over his rivals. Jockey was third on Teaforthree eight years ago. Trainer also involved in the bloodstock industry and sourced the Grand National contender Acapella Bourgeois and former champion hurdler Hurricane Fly.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 33-123. POTTERS CORNERTrainer: Christian Williams Jockey: Jack Tudor Form: 11-37P Age: 11 Weight: 10-06Nationals are this lad\'s game. Winner of the Midlands National the Welsh National and even the Virtual Grand National - a computer-animated race in 2020 when the real thing was called off because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Laid-back trainer exercises his horses on the beach at Ogmore-by-Sea. Potters Corner is part-owned by rugby union star Jonathan Davies and would be the first winner based in Wales for more than a century.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 25-124. CLASS CONTITrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Brian HayesForm: 2-P034 Age: 9 Weight: 10-06 Good ground could put this unsung contender into the top class. While trainer\'s main hope appears to be Burrows Saint there is encouragement from Class Conti\'s third-placed finish in the Thyestes Chase and Leinster National fourth although both were with softer conditions. Jockey having his first ride in the race and recent winning debutants include David Mullins on Rule The World in 2016.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 33-125. MILAN NATIVE Trainer: Denise Foster (IRE) Jockey: Jamie CoddForm: -12P09Age: 8 Weight: 10-06Won last year\'s Kim Muir Chase at the Cheltenham Festival but jumped poorly when ninth in the Ultima this time. Good run behind subsequent Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Minella Indo at Wexford earlier in the season. Trained by Denise Foster while Gordon Elliott serves a suspension. Elliott did say this horse could be very well handicapped when the weights were announced in February. Just beat Discorama who was carrying 4lb more weight by a short head earlier in the season.Rating: 8/10 Odds:33-126. DISCORAMATrainer: Paul Nolan (IRE) Jockey: Brian CooperForm: 833-25 Age: 8 Weight: 10-06 Long looked a National type for owners Tom Friel and Andrew Gemmell and has been placed three times at the Cheltenham Festival. Friel is landlord of the Black Lion pub in Plaistow east London a popular venue for West Ham fans. He first met Gemmell who has been blind since birth when the Hammers fan popped in for a pint. Trainer scored with Mrs Milner at Cheltenham under a talented jockey who is on the rise again.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 16-127. VIEUX LION ROUGETrainer: David Pipe Jockey: Conor O\'FarrellForm: 97-510 Age: 12 Weight: 10-05 Name means Old Red Lion in English and these fences have not tamed this lion-hearted runner. Has successfully jumped nine times in all finishing seventh sixth ninth and 15th in the National itself. Another safe trip expected although age and stamina could be against him. Trainer won with Comply Or Die in 2008 14 years after his father triumphed with Miinnehoma owned by the late comedian Freddie Starr.Rating: 6/10 Odds:40-128. CLOTH CAPTrainer: Jonjo O\'Neill (IRE) Jockey: Tom ScudamoreForm: 28-311 Age: 9 Weight: 10-05Head-turning wins at Newbury and Kelso leave him officially a stone \'well in\' at the weights. Named after owner Trevor Hemmings\' favourite headgear victory would be a record fourth in the race for him. Trainer landed the National once in 2010 with Don\'t Push It ridden by AP McCoy. Jockey from good stock - his grandfather Michael won with Oxo in 1959.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 4-129. CABARET QUEENTrainer: Willie Mullins (IRE) Jockey: Sean O\'KeeffeForm: 31238P Age: 9 Weight: 10-05Owned by a syndicate that includes sports broadcaster Mike Vince was a bargain buy for racing at \xc2\xa313000. Gave them all a day to remember when crowned the Kerry National winner at Listowel in September. Had previously also won the Munster National but this represents a much stiffer test for the mare. Trainer looks to have better chances including Burrows Saint. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-130. MINELLACELEBRATIONTrainer: Katy Price Jockey: Ben PosteForm: -11UU7 Age: 11 Weight: 10-05Trained by Katy Price (no not that one) and has not been a model of consistency but has won twice this season. Been unlucky to unseat his rider twice. This was the first horse trained by Price and she pledged a few weeks ago not to drink any booze until he wins the National. Not the most obvious selection but the National is known for winners providing unusual stories. "We want to be that story" says Price.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 66-131. CANELOTrainer: Alan King Jockey: Tom BellamyForm: 012143 Age: 8 Weight: 10-04Boxing fans who follow the name will be hoping this Canelo is not on the ropes too soon and needs to prove he can stay the distance. Wins at Wetherby and Aintree this season offer some encouragement. One of seven runners in the race for owner JP McManus who looks to have better chances with Minella Times Any Second Now and Kimberlite Candy.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 33-132. THE LONG MILETrainer: Philip Dempsey (IRE) Jockey: Luke DempseyForm: 1-F103 Age: 7 Weight: 10-04Could be well-named if it turns out that this stamina-sapping trip over more than four and a quarter miles suits. First runner in the race for trainer and one of the less-fancied contenders for owner JP McManus. Decent third to the Willie Mullins-trained duo Acapella Bourgeois and Burrows Saint at Fairyhouse last time and now better off at the weights. Jockey rides for trainer father.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 40-133. GIVE ME A COPPERTrainer: Paul Nicholls Jockey: Sean BowenForm: /17-2P Age: 11 Weight: 10-04Part-owner Sir Alex Ferguson always loves a big win in Liverpool although this one would be against the odds. Won the Badger Beers Silver Trophy at Wincanton in November 2019. Trainer has admitted it has been tricky to get the horse ready for the race and will be hoping Give Me A Copper is straighter than some of the coppers in popular police drama Line Of Duty. Jockey a late replacement for the injured Harry Cobden.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 33-134. FARCLASTrainer: Denise Foster (IRE) Jockey: Jack KennedyForm: 1-5342 Age: 7 Trainer: 10-03Like stablemate Tiger Roll the two-time National winner this runner has previously won a Triumph Hurdle. No seven-year-old has won for 71 years and Farclas\' stamina is unproven. Stayed on well to finish second behind The Shunter over a much shorter trip at Cheltenham last month though. Jockey has revived career after breaking leg three times and won last month\'s Gold Cup on Minella Indo. Rating: 6/10 Odds: 33-135. MINELLA TIMESTrainer: Henry de Bromhead (IRE) Jockey: Rachael BlackmoreForm: 20-122 Age: 8 Weight: 10-03Time for a bit of history? Rachael Blackmore\'s mount is sure to be popular after she became the first woman to be leading jockey at the Cheltenham Festival. A 50-1 chance in February he is now one of the leading fancies with an in-form trainer who won the Cheltenham Gold Cup with Minella Indo. A win and two seconds this season and could be improving.Rating: 8/10 Odds: 10-136. SUB LIEUTENANTTrainer: Georgie Howell Jockey: Tabitha WorsleyForm: 4-0244 Age: 12 Weight: 10-03This would be some story. Jockey riding for her trainer mother can claim to have a 100% record round the track after winning on her only previous ride - in the Foxhunters\' Chase over the National fences on Top Wood two years ago. That was 18 months after she broke her back in a fall. Trainer only has seven horses in the yard but Sub Lieutenant should not be all at sea on this track - finished second in the Topham Chase two years ago.Rating: 7/10 Odds: 100-137. HOGAN\'S HEIGHTTrainer: Jamie Snowden Jockey: Gavin SheehanForm: 715-P6 Age: 10 Weight: 10-03First runner in the race for trainer and the horse does have winning form over the National fences - in the Grand Sefton Chase in December 2019. That race is over a significantly shorter distance and there is a question mark over whether he can hit the heights over a much longer run. Partly owned by the Foxtrot Racing Syndicate whose 20 members include a roofer and housekeeper. If he wins it will raise the\xe2\x80\xa6 you know the rest.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 40-138. DOUBLE SHUFFLETrainer: Tom George Jockey: Jonathan BurkeForm: 7-9316 Age: 11 Weight: 10-02Would be a real contender if back to the form of his second place in the 2017 King George VI Chase and if able to see out the trip but that\'s two big ifs already. Did win at Kempton in January - 1474 days after his last victory. Owned by businessman Nic Williamson and hairdresser Max Fawbert who met when Williamson popped in to his salon for a haircut. Rating: 6/10 Odds:50-139. AMI DESBOISTrainer: Graeme McPherson Jockey: Kielan WoodsForm: 62P-22 Age: 11 Weight: 10-02Trainer is also a lawyer but even this QC might struggle to make a strong case for Ami Desbois being the National winner. "I\'ve got a picture of Red Rum winning his third National above my desk and it\'s always been an absolute dream to have a runner in it" he says from his Cotswold stables. His first runner in the race and a debut ride for the jockey. Good second to Double Shuffle in January but Ami Desbois has not won since 2017.Rating: 5/10 Odds: 100-140. BLAKLIONTrainer: Dan Skelton Jockey: Harry SkeltonForm: 85/074 Age: 12 Weight: 10-02 Sent off the 8-1 favourite for the 2017 National having won the previous year\'s RSA Chase at the Cheltenham Festival when trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies. Has not won since Becher Chase victory more than three years ago. Rider is the brother\'s trainer and involved in an epic tussle with Brian Hughes to be champion jockey. The Skeltons are sons of Nick the Olympic equestrian gold medallist.Rating: 6/10 Odds: 50-1Top StoriesKudela & Kamara both banned in race row2habout 2 hours agoFrom the section FootballMan Utd alter seat coverings to aid team1habout 1 hour agoFrom the section FootballFeel-good Northern Ireland the ultimate underdog story8habout 8 hours agoFrom the section FootballAlso in SportWatch: The moment Matsuyama becomes first Japanese men\'s major winner Watch: Spieth Rose & Fleetwood feature in best shots of Masters 2021 \'Tottenham\'s caution does not suit Kane\' - is it time for the striker to quit Spurs? \'My mates said they\'ll never pay for beers again\' - Morris on becoming IPL\'s most expensive signing \'We will rise to the occasion in Six Nations final\' Forgotten man to England starter?

It might come as a surprise to some travelers but all of these scenes play out in Panama -- the Central American country that has long been known mostly for its famous canal.For me Panama was a revelation in the best possible way. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that other Central American countries like Costa Rica and Belize get more tourism buzz. But when I got the opportunity to accompany a friend who was visiting her daughter serving in the Peace Corps in Panama I jumped at the chance to experience a culture that would be new to me.What I found was a delightful combination of abundant beaches hidden waterfalls seafood-focused cuisine and fascinating history. Oh and there\xe2\x80\x99s also the 51-mile-long Panama Canal -- a true marvel and one of the seven modern wonders of the world.There are so many things to love about this small country and here are eight of the best.1. Two Oceans In One DayBecause Panama is about 30 miles across at its narrowest point and 115 miles at its widest you can easily take in its two coasts in one day and if you prefer in an hour or two. On the west and south side of the country you have the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east the Caribbean Sea.What is especially wonderful about the double-ocean scenario is that despite their proximity the two seas have completely different vibes. The Pacific side is all about wide sandy beaches with waves tumbling toward shore. And the Caribbean side is everything you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from a tropical paradise -- white sand aquamarine water and swaying palm trees.On the Pacific side my traveling companions and I loved the Gulf of Chiriqui\xe2\x80\x99s Las Lajas a laid-back resort with miles of open beach perfect for wave jumping and long walks. On the Caribbean side there is Bocas del Toro a mashup of lush rainforest little islands and the country\xe2\x80\x99s most popular beaches.The Visit Panama website describes the Pacific side as \xe2\x80\x9chot winds lush vegetation lots of sun and if you\xe2\x80\x99re lucky humpback whales.\xe2\x80\x9d On the Caribbean side visitors can expect calmer waves relaxing breezes and hundreds of tropical islands.Cindy Barks2. The San Blas IslandsSpeaking of tropical paradise the San Blas Islands (which includes the indigenous province Guna Yala) seem to have written the book on the topic. The stunning string of islands certainly wowed me. San Blas -- a territory of the Guna (or Kuna) indigenous group -- is made up of a narrow strip of land on the Caribbean side of the country along with an archipelago of 365 islands only 50 of which are inhabited by the Guna people.Before heading out on our three-day adventure to the remote landmass of Isla Diablo we were cautioned that the accommodations would be rustic. And they were -- featuring thatched huts sand floors and rudimentary toilets and showers. But with the powdery white sand and shimmering blue water spread before us we hardly noticed.Getting to the islands can be a bit of a feat requiring a 2.5-hour drive from Panama City to Carti the main port of the San Blas Islands. There you will transfer to boats that will take you to the various island destinations. Our boat ride lasted nearly an hour through choppy waters.Still the trip is certainly doable for mature travelers so visitors shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the slight inconveniences deter them. We were at our little piece of paradise in time for a late lunch and the stay turned out to be a highlight of my trip.Note that varied accommodation types are available including bungalows sailboats and catamarans. The VRBO website offers a variety of options and prices. The Visit Panama site suggests stopping off at El Porvenir which is the capital of Guna Yala or Isla Perro for amazing snorkeling.Pro TipsWe made sure to stock up on a few basic conveniences before heading out to the islands knowing that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to shops or convenience stores. Once in our little hut we were glad that we had brought along snacks and a few drinks of choice. Also visitors should be sure to wear sunscreen and a hat on the long sunny boat rides between the islands.3. Historic Casco ViejoDating back three and a half centuries Panama\xe2\x80\x99s old quarter Casco Viejo (also known as Casco Antiguo) offers a glimpse into the days of gracious plazas and colonial-style architecture. The old quarter designated a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site was established in 1673 after the previous 1500s-era city center was attacked and looted by pirate Henry Morgan.The best plan for exploring Casco Viejo is to wander the winding brick-paved streets and take in the quaint courtyards markets and ruins. Along the way be sure to stop by the Metropolitan Cathedral located on the main square Plaza Mayor and also take in the Church of San Jose known for its golden altar. Another highlight is the Plaza de Francia which pays homage to the French role in the construction of the Panama Canal.Pro TipA trek through Casco Viejo should also include a stop or two at the restaurants and bars that are plentiful in the neighborhood. In my mind there\xe2\x80\x99s no better way to beat the tropical heat than to sit in an outdoor patio sipping a Balboa or Panama beer.Cindy Barks4. Cosmopolitan Panama CityThe historic part of town is just a small section of the sprawling metropolis of Panama City. The rest of the city is definitely worth exploring for its diverse ethnic cuisine offerings shining skyscrapers and great shopping.The Visit Panama website describes the capital city as three cities in one with a historic district a rebuilt district and very modern areas. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a UNESCO creative city for gastronomy Panama City is home to a vibrant and diverse food scene led by world-class chefs\xe2\x80\x9d says the website. Along with the delicious and unique Panamanian food virtually every ethnic cuisine seems to be available in Panama City as well.5. Panama CanalNo visit to Panama would be complete without seeing its namesake canal -- an engineering achievement that looms large in the country\xe2\x80\x99s identity.Like most Americans much of my previous knowledge about Panama had come from school history lessons about the arduous task of digging the Panama Canal in the early 1900s and decades later about the handover of control of the canal from the United States to Panama.I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see the phenomenon in person and visiting the canal from Panama City turned out to be fairly easy. The Miraflores Visitor Center which offers viewing platforms is a 15-minute drive from downtown Panama City and the Agua Clara Locks are a 1-hour drive from the city. There is also the option of a boat-ride tour through the crossing itself.Once at the canal visitors will find a somewhat hectic scene with ships from all over the world making the short-cut journey between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. I found it fascinating to watch the elaborate lock system lift massive ships up to the elevation of the canal.6. The CevicheAnother notable feature of Panama is its ample seafood and perhaps no other dish brings it all together like ceviche the delicious creation of marinated raw fish or seafood.For a staggering assortment of ceviche types head to Panama City\xe2\x80\x99s Mercado de Mariscos a busy fish market where dozens of vendors peddle their versions of the Panamanian favorite. You will find vats of octopus shrimp and fish spiced up with lime juice chile peppers and cilantro. The casual booths serve their creations in cups alongside servings of thick tortilla chips or saltines. Outdoor tables are available for a seaside lunch.7. Indigenous ArtPanama is home to six indigenous groups and each of the cultures has an art style of its own.The most well-known example of the artworks is the colorful mola created by the Guna people. The meticulously stitched textiles are available for sale all over the San Blas Islands and at markets in Panama City. My advice is if you see one you like buy it because you likely won\xe2\x80\x99t find the exact design again.Other crafts such as beaded jewelry purses with geometric designs and colorful blouses and dresses can be found throughout the country.Pro TipFor a close-up look at the history of molas head to the Museo de la Mola which features the textile art of the Guna people. (Because of temporary COVID-19-related closures be sure to check ahead for availability.)Cindy Barks8. Coffee PlantationsAs if the gorgeous beaches and captivating history weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough Panama features another dimension as well in its rainforest-covered mountains where coffee is the prominent crop.The pretty little town of Boquete located on the western end of Panama not far from the border with Costa Rica is the perfect base for exploring the coffee region. Choices for touring and sampling are numerous but for a chance to shop tour and hike in a lushly beautiful atmosphere I loved Finca Lerida about a half-hour drive from Boquete.Pro TipTypically a number of major airlines including United Delta and American offer flights to Panama City\xe2\x80\x99s main airport Tocumen International Airport with direct flights from cities such as Houston Dallas Los Angeles Miami and New York City. The airport\xe2\x80\x99s website offers tips here for getting from the airport to the city center located about a half-hour drive away.Further Reading:What To Expect At Carnaval In PanamaWhy I Can't Wait To Go Back To The Thousand Polleras Parade In Las Tablas Panama15 Best Islands In The World To Retire On In 2021CategoriesDestinationsCentral and South AmericaPanamaCindy BarksView Full ProfileCindy Barks is an Arizona-based newspaper reporter freelance travel writer and travel blogger.

In an interview with the Breeze Livingstone-Macleod MLA Roger Reid said he signed the letter not because he lacked confidence in Premier Jason Kenney or the government but because he wanted to advocate for a regional approach to health measures. \xe2\x80\x9cPopulation density lifestyle so many things play into the difference of the impact of Covid in our rural communities than ... in a higher-density urban population. The impacts to mental health the impacts to families the impacts to seniors the impacts to small businesses play out differently out here\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re 13 months into the pandemic and I really felt it was time to broaden the tool kit when we look at the restrictions in place.\xe2\x80\x9d The MLA also emphasized the letter was not about denying the science behind Covid-19 or the seriousness of the pandemic. \xe2\x80\x9cI personally know people who have passed away and I have friends who have lost family members due to Covid. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Covid denier\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Reid said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not on a side that says this is a hoax but I believe that a year in with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned we have an opportunity to take a look at the economic the mental health and even the physical health aspects outside the virus itself.\xe2\x80\x9d Currently the province has a four-step reopening plan based on the number of hospitalizations resulting from Covid-19 and decreasing case numbers. Although still below the 450 hospitalizations dictated by Step 2 government models projected case numbers would total over 2000 a day with hospitals being overrun with Covid patients by May if further restrictions were not implemented. As of April 13 88 Covid-19 patients were in intensive-care units. There are 179 ICU beds across Alberta though the province has the ability to redesignate other departments to create surge capacity. Such redesignations however limit what health services can be provided. Though the hospital capacity is an important issue Mr. Reid said the mental health and viability of rural communities deserves equal attention. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Covid pandemic is not only affecting our hospital capacity and ICU capacity\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only part of the equation that we need to look at. The letter was my encouragement to say how can we find a way to look at a broader matrix when we put these restrictions in place whether we increase them or relax them because we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing first-hand the effects of many other things besides the virus itself that the pandemic is having \xe2\x80\x94 not only on Albertans but people around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the main obstacles in implementing regional approaches to health restrictions is that care for individuals experiencing serious Covid symptoms is limited to urban centres. Just because an area might not have high case counts the possibility of people contracting the disease presents an ever-present danger of straining available health resources. One potential solution said the Livingstone-Macleod MLA is to offload medical treatment like non-essential surgeries to rural hospitals to take some of the strain off urban centres. While initiating a regional approach would require more work at collecting data to determine individual circumstances surrounding positivity rates Mr. Reid said the letter is a sign members of the UCP are willing to do more to help. \xe2\x80\x9cReally it\xe2\x80\x99s just an affirmation that MLAs like me are here ready to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work make sure we bring the best solutions forward to Albertans to get us through this in the healthiest way possible\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Sean Oliver Local Journalism Initiative Reporter Shootin\' the Breeze3 minutes agoThe Canadian PressHarris planning first trip abroad to Mexico GuatemalaWASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Vice-President Kamala Harris is planning a trip to Mexico and Guatemala as she leads the White House\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic efforts to tackle the migration challenge at the U.S. southern border. Harris told reporters Wednesday that she was \xe2\x80\x9clooking forward to travelling hopefully as my first trip to the Northern Triangle\xe2\x80\x9d with stops in Mexico and Guatemala planned. She said she would go as soon as possible depending on restrictions put in place for the pandemic. But when asked if she would visit the border Harris suggested she had no plans to do so noting that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had been tasked by the president with dealing with the increase in migration there while she was focused on dealing with the root causes of migration to the U.S. It\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s certain to fuel criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing enough to address the large increase in migration at the border. Harris and President Joe Biden both have been hammered by GOP lawmakers for not visiting the border even as jarring photos of minors held in overcrowded detention centres drew fresh attention to the issue. Biden has dispatched a number of top aides to evaluate the situation at the border instead. Indeed Republican lawmakers returning from a border trip blamed the Biden administration for the problems arguing for a return to Trump-era policies. They said the president and vice-president need to go to the border to see firsthand the migrant surge. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can stop this today\xe2\x80\x9d said Rep. Steve Scalise R-La. the GOP whip. \xe2\x80\x9cVice-President Harris needs to go down to the border and see this for herself.\xe2\x80\x9d The increase in migration to the U.S. has become one of Biden\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges in the early months of his administration. In March a record number of unaccompanied children attempted to cross the border and the Border Patrol saw its largest number of encounters overall with migrants on the southern border \xe2\x80\x94 just under 170000 \xe2\x80\x94 in two decades. Numbers grew sharply during Trump\xe2\x80\x99s final year in office but further accelerated under Biden who quickly ended many of his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s policies including one that made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in the U.S. Harris meanwhile faces her own set of challenges in taking on a problem that has long eluded any easy solutions. She\xe2\x80\x99s been tasked with overseeing diplomatic efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras which includes pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their borders while also developing and implementing a long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries. On Wednesday Harris was leading a briefing with a handful of experts focused on those very issues and she acknowledged in remarks to reporters that solving the region\'s problems would take time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to figure out how to assess our impact\xe2\x80\x9d she said but added \xe2\x80\x9cit will not be obvious overnight.\xe2\x80\x9d "The work we have to do is going to require a commitment that is continuous that we institutionalize with our partners\xe2\x80\x9d and that includes a long-term strategy in the region Harris said. She added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt will take some time to see the benefits of that work but it will be worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 AP writer Lisa Mascaro contributed reporting.

In late March WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a mission to study the origins of the virus was too quick to dismiss the theory of a lab leak.Russia Says No Clotting Cases From Sputnik (10:45 a.m. NY)The developers of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Sputnik V vaccine said it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t produced any instances of the dangerous blood-clotting that forced U.S. officials to urge a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine.Sputnik\xe2\x80\x99s first dose uses the same human adenovirus as the Johnson & Johnson inoculation but they have \xe2\x80\x9csignificant differences in their structure\xe2\x80\x9d and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t appropriate to extrapolate safety data from one to the other the state-run Gamaleya Center said in a statement.Switzerland Allows Theaters to Open (10:45 a.m. NY)Switzerland will allow theaters cinemas and outdoor dining at restaurants to open starting Monday pursuing once again a more liberal course than many of its European neighbors.While facilities will be subject to capacity limitations the move stands in contrast to France where officials have responded to an increase in Covid-19 infections by doubling down on restrictions.Outdoor events will be limited to 100 people while indoors at cinemas or concerts the maximum is 50.EU Sees J&J Recommendation Next Week (9:43 a.m. NY)The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s drug regulator is accelerating its review of blood-clot reports with J&J\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine and said it expects to issue a recommendation next week.EU member states should store doses as they await guidance and the European Medicines Agency said it will decide shortly whether \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory action is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9dAstra Shot Induces Strong T-Cell Response (9:40 a.m. NY)The Astra vaccine generated a stronger cellular immune response than the Pfizer and BioNTech shot in people over 80 years old a study by U.K. researchers shows.Responses in T cells -- a type of white blood cell that helps fight viruses -- were seen in 31% of participants receiving the Astra vaccine and 12% of the Pfizer-BioNTech group according to the University of Birmingham and U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium. Elderly people receiving a single dose of either vaccine showed equivalent antibody responses after five weeks.It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if the different levels of T cell responses observed will have any impact on clinical effectiveness the researchers said.NYC Reschedules 4000 Appointments (9:29 a.m. NY)New York City had to reschedule 4000 shots on Tuesday due to the Johnson & Johnson pause according to Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi. The \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of New Yorkers will keep the same appointments but receive the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead.The city\xe2\x80\x99s homebound senior vaccine program which depended on the J&J shot will be suspended through Sunday but the city is working to reschedule appointments and arrange transports by taxi or ambulette Chokshi said.Denmark Is First in EU to Drop Astra Shot (8:14 a.m. NY)Denmark has become the first country in the European Union to drop AstraZeneca Plc\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine from its inoculation program amid concerns over blood clots.Denmark was one of the first countries to suspend the vaccine on March 11. At the time the Danish Health Authority called the decision a precautionary move and reiterated its view that Astra\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine was \xe2\x80\x9ceffective and safe.\xe2\x80\x9dPfizer to Speed EU Deliveries (7:42 a.m. NY)Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE will raise Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to the European Union by 50 million this quarter offering good news to the bloc after Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s shot was paused.The drugmakers will bring forward deliveries scheduled for the fourth quarter European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. The additional supplies will add to the 200 million doses the EU was already expecting from Pfizer through June.

One Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues said that no one was found to have committed any misconduct. Instead they were guilty of \xe2\x80\x9cperformance shortcomings." The long-overdue report was triggered by widespread objections including from Congress after one of the D.C. Guard helicopters hovered low enough over protesters near the Capitol One Arena to create a deafening noise and spray protesters with rotor wash. Officials demanded to know why the D.C. Guard used one of the medivac helicopters to make such a \xe2\x80\x9cshow of force\xe2\x80\x9d against the crowds gathered to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer. And officials raised questions about whether proper approval was given to use the medical aircraft for the mission. The report found that the use of medical helicopters was appropriate because of the ongoing emergency situation as the protests got violent. Demonstrators set fires broke store windows and stole items from the shelves and left police officers and Guard members injured. But Army officials said the aircrews did not have clear guidance as they flew over the downtown area. They said some crew believed they were simply supposed to circle and observe the crowd while others thought they were supposed to have a larger deterrence presence. The Army officials spoke on condition of anonymity to several reporters to describe details of the report. The report which was reviewed by the Army and the Defence Department\'s inspector general said that an analysis of FAA flight data found that one helicopter did hover below 100 feet near a crowd by the arena. Army officials said there is now a very strict process to get approval for the use of aircraft for city events. And they noted that none have been used since the June incident. The report also recommended improved planning training and oversight of the Guard\'s use of aviation in civil disturbance operations. And it called for a review of Army guidance to make sure it addresses any aviation questions. The release of the report comes in the midst of the murder trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin who has been accused of killing Floyd during a confrontation last May when he pinned the Black man to the pavement with his knee for more than nine minutes. Floyd\'s death set off protests nationwide including in Washington D.C. where then-President Donald Trump encouraged authorities to get tougher to quash the unrest. An overpowering security force \xe2\x80\x94 officers from the FBI Hostage Rescue Team the Secret Service the Drug Enforcement Administration the Bureau of Prisons and more than 2000 National Guard troops \xe2\x80\x94 spread out across the city creating a perimeter around the White House and protecting other national monuments. John Whitley Acting Secretary of the Army said the service is refining its regulations to address the matter. And officials said changes are being made to training and other policies including the adoption of a formal approval process for Army aviation missions around the capital. The commanding general of the D.C. Guard Maj. Gen. William Walker initially launched an investigation into the matter. But the probe has languished for months as the Army the Defence Department inspector general and others have reviewed it and made some changes. As an example Walker initially concluded that the use of the medical aircraft was not appropriate. But subsequent reviews at higher levels changed that. The final report Army officials said found that there is no law prohibiting it and that it was permissible because of the emergency situation in the city. Lolita C.
