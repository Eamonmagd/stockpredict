Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold issuing the highest AMC price target on Wall Street last Monday.In a note to clients Wold said he was "impressed" that Godzilla vs. Kong\'s box-office debut smashed pandemic records and he recommended investors buy AMC shares on an improved Covid-19 outlook saying the stock\'s price could go up to $13.Chief CriticWall Street\'s most negative outlook on AMC comes courtesy of Lightshed Partners which issued a price target for shares of just $0.01 last month. "The future of movie-going is not in doubt" Lightshed analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a note. "The future of AMC Theaters however is very much in doubt with its current stock price dramatically overvalued." Greenfield also said there is a "substantial disconnect" between the company\'s expected revenue and its increasing debt load. The company raised $1.3 billion in debt during the pandemic to help stay afloat and it posted a net loss of nearly $4.6 billion last year.TangentAMC isn\'t the only meme stock falling hard on Monday. GameStop shares are down 14% after Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo warned that the stock\'s Reddit-fueled rally will fade in the long run "to match [GameStop\'s] current weak results and outlook."Key BackgroundThe pandemic has been terrible for the leisure space and particularly bad for AMC. Despite beating analyst expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings report last month the firm\'s total revenues of about $1.2 billion last year were just 23% of the sales it pulled in 2019. Greenfield says the firm will likely need to rely on additional share offerings to raise more money to stay afloat which will further dilute the stock\'s value. Despite the Monday plunge AMC shares are still up more than 300% this year but Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson on Monday said that "very high" leverage in the financial system "could spell more trouble for riskier more speculative investments." The number of AMC shares on loan is at an all-time high of 132 million according to financial analytics platform Ortex.Further ReadingAMC Skyrockets After Chinese Billionaire\xe2\x80\x99s Firm Cuts Stake Ushering In Bullish Reddit Traders (Forbes)Jonathan PoncianoI\'m a reporter at Forbes focusing on markets and finance.

The phenomenon that raised AMC (NYSE:AMC) stock above pre-pandemic prices twice in recent months doesn\xe2\x80\x99t account for this. AMC has finished trading above $13 per share on two occasions in 2021; at the end of January and again in mid-March.Source: rblfmr/Shutterstock.comFundamentally there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to suggest it should have risen that high. It simply is another WallStreetBets flash in the pan.Intuition tells me that AMC stock will rise when movie theater attendance begins moving upward even though the stock shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Despite that belief financial realities indicate that AMC is going to fall below pre-pandemic prices of $6-7.Movie AttendanceThe truth is that the movie theater experience isn\xe2\x80\x99t what it once was. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that the experience has become worse per se but rather that a shift has long been underway. Box office sales peaked nearly 20 years ago in 2002 when 1.58 billion tickets were sold. Ticket sales decreased to 1.23 billion by 2019. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a gutting of demand but when population increases are taken into account tickets declined on a 31% per capita basis.The main argument in favor of an AMC stock purchase is that it\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest movie theater company in North America as measured by number of screens. Redditors and other pundits assume that pent up demand will drive movie-goers through AMC\xe2\x80\x99s doors. As a result share prices will rise.I agree with the logic partially. I think prices will rise because of the short-sighted nature of the markets today. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure AMC prices are going to drop back to around where they were before the pandemic.It is really just a matter of timing and little more. If I were going to make a bet on AMC \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99m not \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d simply try to time the markets based on a few factors.Vaccine NumbersRight now 35.9% of the U.S. populace has received at least 1 vaccine dose and 21.9% are fully vaccinated. Of course this will go a long way toward bringing foot traffic into AMC\xe2\x80\x99s theaters.Estimates are that 70%-80% of the population will need to be fully vaccinated in order for herd immunity to occur. I have to assume that as that number is approached AMC is going to see a spike in foot traffic.AMC isn\xe2\x80\x99t staggering its theater openings based on that by any means. In fact 99% of the company\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. theaters are currently open.Say what you will about that some might consider it irresponsible greedy or just plain dangerous. But the real kicker is AMC\xe2\x80\x99s shareholder letter which contains \xe2\x80\x9cProposal 1\xe2\x80\x9d for voting.Shareholders Between a Rock and a Hard PlaceAMC is proposing that its shareholders allow the company to amend its charter and increase the total number of shares by 500 million to a total of 1.024 billion.AMC is trying to sell shareholders with promises of debt reduction increased liquidity increased negotiation leverage and ability to pursue growth opportunities.Surely the company can use the proceeds from an equity capital raise to do all of those things. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t lying. But in the process shares become diluted by as much as nearly 50%.It\xe2\x80\x99s clear the company is truly desperate despite its rosy PR language. Shareholders are in a tough spot. Vote \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d and there\xe2\x80\x99s every chance shares run to zero. Vote \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 and your shares become immediately less valuable.AMC\xe2\x80\x99s revenues were gutted by the pandemic. They dropped precipitously between 2019 and 2020. But the industry has been trending down for a long time. My guess is that most current shareholders are hanging on to the sinking ship that is AMC. They\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the most graceful exit into the sea below. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a great place to be so don\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself in their shoes by establishing a position in AMC stock now.On the date of publication Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Alex Sirois is a freelance contributor to InvestorPlace whose personal stock investing style is focused on long-term buy-and-hold wealth-building stock picks.\xe2\x80\xafHaving worked in several industries from e-commerce to translation to education and utilizing his MBA from George Washington University he brings a diverse set of skills through which he filters his writing.\xe2\x80\x9dArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/amc-stock-and-its-investment-case-are-clear-abandon-ship/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

You\'ll often find him writing about Obamacare marijuana drug and device development Social Security taxes retirement issues and general macroeconomic topics of interest. Follow @TMFUltraLongA new year has brought a new type of volatility to Wall Street. Whereas the coronavirus pandemic whipsawed equities last year retail investors are one of the primary causes of equity vacillations in 2021.Beginning in mid-January retail investors on Reddit\'s WallStreetBets (WSB) chatroom began allying with each other to buy shares and call options in stocks with very high levels of short interest. The goal for these mostly young and novice investors has been to effect a short squeeze. Since institutional investors and hedge funds hold a majority of the short-sold positions in the stocks targeted by the WSB community this has been construed as a battle between retail investors and the so-called "big money."While there have been dozens of stocks that benefited at least temporarily from the WSB community\'s efforts video game and accessories retailer GameStop\xc2\xa0and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) have been the go-to for retail investors. Between the two AMC is arguably the most polarizing.Image source: Getty Images.Retail investors\' case for AMCThere are no shortage of reasons the WSB army of investors believes AMC will head higher. Chief among them is the idea that it\'ll undergo yet another squeeze which could be even larger than the one that sent shares from $2 to $20 in a matter of days earlier this year. As of mid-March data from Morningstar\xc2\xa0showed that 49.3 million shares of AMC were held short. That\'s up about 1.2 million shares from mid-February. The hope here is that one or more good news events could cause pessimists to head for the exit pushing AMC\'s share price higher. Of course with AMC\'s short ratio plummeting in recent months a sustained short squeeze looks extremely unlikely.Retail investors are also big backers of the reopening trade. The U.S. is leading the way among developed countries when it comes to coronavirus vaccinations. The quicker adults are vaccinated the more likely it is that life can return to its pre-pandemic normal. In the case of AMC this could mean lessening or removing its theater capacity restrictions. Remember it\'s not just about the movies that consumers are going to see. It\'s about getting more people to the high-margin concessions stands.Enthusiasts have rallied behind AMC\'s capital-raising efforts as well. According to CEO Adam Aron the company raised $2.8 billion via share offerings and debt capital since the pandemic began. In the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings report the company noted that it had more than $1 billion in cash available.Image source: Getty Images.AMC is weeks away from a no-win scenarioOn the other hand I\'ve made it no secret that I\'m extremely skeptical of AMC\'s ability to turn its business around or perhaps even survive over the long run. The way I see it AMC Entertainment is just weeks away from a no-win scenario.Back in March the company filed a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating its desire to put a number of items to vote by its shareholders on May 4. Among them is the ability for AMC to issue up to 500 million shares of Class A stock. If approved this would effectively double the existing authorization and allow up to 1.024 billion shares to be outstanding.To be clear AMC isn\'t necessarily going to issue any shares. According to Aron in an interview with CNBC:Dilution is something we care about but I would also tell you we are formally asking for approval from our shareholders to authorize another 500 million shares that the company could issue if it wishes. There are a lot of benefits to our shareholders of having board-authorized shares out in the market. We will be sensitive to dilution issues. At the same time though there\'s an opportunity to bolster our cash reserves. There\'s an opportunity to buy back debt at a discount. There might be an opportunity to defray some of our deferred theater rents; settling with stock instead of cash; maybe there\'s some merger and acquisition opportunity where we could buy other companies inexpensively using our stock as currency there are a lot of good reasons for shareholders to give us the authority to have more shares.Image source: Getty Images.While I can appreciate Aron\'s cheerleading it\'s misguided at best. To think that AMC would consider using its stock as currency to make acquisitions when there\'s $11 billion in convertible and non-convertible debt on its balance sheet as of mid-February according to S&P Global Market Intelligence is foolish (with a small \'f\').What\'s happening on May 4 is a no-win situation for Aron AMC and the company\'s shareholders. If shareholders approve the measure AMC probably guarantees its survival for a long time to come. However being given a free pass to double the outstanding share count will put ceiling on the company\'s share price -- i.e. rallies will be met by AMC selling stock into strength -- and likely crush the hopes of retail investors.Meanwhile if shareholders vote against the measure AMC is going to have a very hard time coming up with the capital needed to survive. Having more than $1 billion in cash staves off the company\'s immediate bankruptcy concerns but it doesn\'t do anything to lessen the company\'s ongoing losses at reduced capacity in its theaters. Plus with $7.2 billion in debt needing to be repaid in 2026 ($6.04 billion of which is traditional and can\'t be converted to equity) AMC has virtually zero hope of lasting another five years without being able to issue hundreds of millions of additional shares.No matter what happens with the May 4 vote there is no good outcome. Approving the share offering would seem the lesser of the two evils because it would least give AMC a shot at long-term survival. But with the company\'s revenue not expected to hit pre-pandemic levels until at least 2024 a return back to a low single-digit share price seems probable given the dilution that would be necessary to ensure its survival.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) had all six of the country's highest-grossing films that year. It was still a challenging period for AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) and its smaller rival exhibitors though. Despite Disney kicking in the final theatrical entry in its Star Wars franchise and the climax of the Avengers saga U.S. box office receipts declined by nearly 5% that year.Things were about to get a lot worse for both businesses. Investors will be quick to point out that this story has a happy ending. Disney stock hit an all-time high last month. AMC shares touched their highest levels in more than two years back in January. However which one would be better to make your next stock purchase? Let's take a closer look at how these two once seemingly inseparable blockbuster partners are now doing their own things to survive if not thrive in the new normal.Image source: Disney.Going in different directionsThe pandemic upended film distribution models and theatrical release windows for Disney. After the early March 2020 release of Onward it would be a solid year before the movie-making powerhouse would deliver a new release to stateside multiplexes -- Raya and the Last Dragon which debuted last month. In the interim its priority became feeding its new Disney+ streaming service.The strategy worked. Disney+ launched in late 2019 and it has already surpassed 100 million subscribers worldwide. Fans aren't flinching at a monthly price increase this year and some of them are fine paying an extra $30 to stream Raya and the Last Dragon or the live-action reboot of Mulan instead of heading out to a movie theater.Even with AMC now approaching full strength with 99% of its locations reopened many of the market's biggest content creators aren't eager to return to the 2019 model of theatrical release windows. Disney recently committed to continue feeding its ascending digital distribution business with films at the same time that they are released in theaters.Investors understand that decision. Disney's stock price moved nicely higher in 2020 even as its revenue posted double-digit year-over-year declines in the final three quarters of the calendar year.AMC wasn't as lucky in 2020. Its stock plummeted 71% last year. Investors left it for dead but that was a mistake. The country's largest multiplex operator has seen its stock more than quadruple in 2021.AMC has tried to make the best of the pandemic as well as the paradigm shift in media consumption trends. It has shifted to offering big-ticket screen rentals during the lull of blockbuster content. It's been beefing up assigned seating and mobile ordering for concessions. It got smarter in some ways during the downturn. The success this month of Godzilla vs. Kong at domestic movie theaters -- and folks returning in even larger numbers for big releases overseas -- should inspire media companies to get back into the multiplex with their most anticipated films. AMC has a shot to get the last laugh here -- but is that enough?Fade to blackIt would be easy to view multiplexes as an endangered species but AMC isn't going to go down without a fight. It's making smart moves to adapt to a climate that will remain challenging for it.However when it comes to singling out the better buy Disney is the clear winner here -- even if one can accurately assert that the stock's price has gotten ahead of itself. A lot is riding on Disney+ and even the media giant doesn't expect the fast-growing platform to turn a profit until 2024. However content is ultimately king. Disney's catalog of franchises and its stellar track record of success make it the undeniable crown wearer here. Disney is the better buy.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.

Here Are 3 Better Recovery Stocks | The Motley FoolPlease ensure Javascript is enabled for purposes of website accessibilityJeremy Bowman(TMFHobo)Apr 9 2021 at 8:00AMAuthor BioFool since 2011. I write about consumer goods the big picture and whatever else piques my interest. Follow me on Twitter to see my latest articles and for commentary on hot topics in retail and the broad market.Follow @tmfbowmanAMC Entertainment\xc2\xa0(NYSE:AMC) has become a darling of investors on the Robinhood trading platform and among users on Reddit in recent months. The sudden interest in the movie theater operator has sent share prices skyrocketing this year up nearly 400% year-to-date.After the company got an infusion of cash to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection some investors now believe the company's value will surge on a wave of pent-up demand later this year as Americans return to pre-pandemic activities like going out to a movie. One possible example of that underlying demand: AT&T's Warner Media film Godzilla vs. Kong brought in $48.5 million over the five-day holiday weekend and it was a hit on AT&T's HBO Max as well (where it was released simultaneously).However after AMC's price surge in recent months the stock is already double where it was trading pre-pandemic and investors have been significantly diluted by an increase in shares issued. Additionally the company has been forced to take on high-interest debt. The dilution and increased debt burden will both weigh heavily on any recovery in the business.For investors looking for recovery stocks there are some better options out there. Here are three of them.Image source: Getty Images.1. Revolve GroupE-commerce was a big winner during the pandemic but one sector within online retail was not. Apparel mostly struggled as consumers focused their spending on direct needs during the crisis like home furnishings to adapt to new work-from-home and learn-from-home protocols. Meanwhile the lack of social events cooled off this segment of the market as apparel sales fell nearly 30% last year according to the Census Bureau.That suggests that the apparel sector should experience a wave of pent-up demand especially as Americans will be eager to spruce up their wardrobes for social activities and returning to the workplace. One company that is likely to get a significant tailwind from this trend is Revolve Group\xc2\xa0(NYSE:RVLV) an influencer-driven online apparel retailer that caters to Gen Z and millennials.The company's biggest category is dresses and it specializes in occasion wear the kind of clothes young adults buy to go to a concert a wedding or another social event. With those gatherings likely to start revving up this summer Revolve should see a spike in demand. There are already signs of a wellspring as spending on going-out clothes is already on the rise.Despite a 3% drop in revenue last year management controlled inventory successfully during 2020 and adjusted EBITDA jumped 25%. That puts the company on strong financial footing heading into the recovery.2. Affirm HoldingsTech stocks aren't generally perceived as being good recovery plays as the industry mostly benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic. But credit card disruptor Affirm Holdings\xc2\xa0(NASDAQ:AFRM) looks like an exception.The recent IPO has been volatile since its debut and now trades near post-IPO lows following a sell-off in March. The central focus of the company's business is a buy-now pay-later offering that allows consumers to pay in fixed installments often at 0% APR. It offers both point-of-sale tools in stores and a consumer app as well as other merchant-based solutions.Affirm is growing fast with gross merchandise volume up 55% in its most recent quarter driving a 57% revenue increase to $204 million but the company's growth could accelerate. With the economy shifting to recovery mode the moment could be perfect for a product like Affirm. Brick-and-mortar retailers have been devastated by the pandemic and many will be looking for a way to drive increased sales to help overcome the pandemic-era losses.Similarly consumers will also be eager to travel buy clothes and spend on restaurants and are ripe for a financial product like Affirm which offers 0% APR products that credit cards can't generally compete with.While Affirm may seem like an indirect way to take advantage of the recovery the recent sell-off offers an appealing entry point for a fast-growing company in high-value business-digital payments. If it capitalizes on the opportunity in front of it the stock should move higher from here.Image source: Walt Disney.3. Walt DisneyWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) may seem like an obvious choice as the diversified entertainment company was hit hard by the pandemic. Even though it's now trading near an all-time high its performance since the beginning of 2020 has only matched the S&P 500. This indicates that investors may still be underappreciating the business as the full potential of Disney+ wasn't yet clear then.After all the pandemic was a surprise tailwind for Disney in some ways as it helped drive staggering growth in Disney+ which now has more than 100 million subscribers. It also led Disney to restructure its entertainment business to prioritize streaming something it previously seemed reluctant to do. The company is now experimenting with releasing new movies direct-to-consumer through Disney+ at the same time they debut in theaters potentially allowing it to capture more revenue from its new movies.The even better news is that Disney will get a major tailwind when its parks and resorts business can reopen to full capacity as that business is likely to see huge pent-up demand come its way. Families will be happy to reward their kids with a vacation to Disney World hoping to put the pandemic behind them and others will make up for trips that were planned for 2020.Disney has arguably the best brand in travel destinations and the attractiveness of its properties only gets stronger when consumers have been deprived of them. In fiscal 2019 its parks and resorts division generated $6.8 billion in operating income and the company should be able to surpass that figure once the pandemic ends.Disney was also forced to suspend its dividend during the pandemic which should return once its business stabilizes encouraging dividend investors to move back into the stock. Altogether Disney will emerge much stronger after the pandemic with a thriving streaming business and what looks like a durable wave of pent-up demand at its parks and resorts properties. That sets it up well to be a long-term winner from here.This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.
