"Knowing the Street they want these turnarounds quite quickly. By this time investors want things to be a bit in better shape."The big-box retailer reaffirmed a prior sales outlook for the coming fiscal year noting that positive sales momentum has carried into the current quarter. Many Americans have turned to the company\'s stores and website during the Covid pandemic to buy cleaning supplies kitchen appliances bedding and other items for their homes.Results in its first quarter however are going to be messy Chief Executive Mark Tritton explained in an interview. In the year-ago period all of Bed Bath & Beyond\'s stores were shut due to the health crisis and it was totally reliant on its digital business to fuel sales. That\'s unlike some retailers notably Walmart and Target that have been able to keep their stores open throughout the pandemic."What you see is some number turbulence" Tritton said. "You\'re going to see a bifurcation in the retail market."Here\'s how the company did during the quarter ended Feb. 27 compared with what analysts were anticipating using a survey by Refinitiv:Earnings per share: 40 cents adjusted vs. 31 cents expectedRevenue: $2.62 billion vs. $2.63 billion expectedBed Bath & Beyond\'s net income during the period grew to $9.1 million or 8 cents per share compared with a loss of $65.4 million or 53 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time adjustments the company earned 40 cents per share better than the 31 cents expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.Net sales fell about 16% to $2.62 billion from $3.11 billion a year earlier. That was slightly short of the $2.63 billion that analysts were anticipating.The company said the year-over-year decline was driven in part by the sale of its Christmas Tree Shops and Cost Plus World Market businesses as well as ongoing store closures.Same-store sales rose 4% the company said. Online sales surged 86% during the fourth quarter but that wasn\'t enough to totally offset reported double-digit declines of in-store traffic. The company noted that 41% of online sales were fulfilled by stores.Within the namesake Bed Bath & Beyond business it saw the most growth in home organization followed by kitchen food prep indoor decor and then bedding. Same-store sales at the Bed Bath & Beyond banner were up 6%.Bed Bath & Beyond reaffirmed its fiscal 2021 sales outlook that it gave back in January which calls for sales to be within a range of $8 billion and $8.2 billion. Analysts were estimating 2021 sales of $8.18 billion according to Refinitiv.The current quarter will be impacted by not only store closures in the year-ago period but also by the company\'s ongoing restructuring. Its four core banners are Bed Bath & Beyond Buybuy Baby Harmon Face Values and Decorist.The retailer is forecasting first-quarter net sales to increase by more than 40% year over year. Analysts had been calling for a 45.8% jump. Excluding the impact from divested businesses however Bed Bath & Beyond said sales from its four core banners could grow upwards of 65% to 70%.\'Early days\'Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark TrittonSource: Bed Bath & BeyondTritton played a crucial role in his previous gig as chief merchant at Target to help the big-box retailer build excitement with customers around exclusive brands and refurbished stores. Wall Street is still waiting to see if he can achieve the same success at Bed Bath & Beyond.As part of Tritton\'s turnaround plans Bed Bath & Beyond is in the process of remodeling roughly 130 to 150 stores this fiscal year including 26 remodels during the first quarter. It just completed its first batch in the Houston market in February.The company said it will spend about $250 million over the next three years to remodel roughly 450 Bed Bath & Beyond shops in total. That involves decluttering aisles and removing sky-high piles of merchandise often seen on top shelves adding fresh signage and installing more modern light fixtures."It\'s early days" Tritton told CNBC about the remodels. "Normally we have a period of adjustment as we go through every remodel ... it\'s about a 12-week process."Bed Bath & Beyond is also bolstering its roster of private labels across different categories of home goods. It\'s planning to launch at least eight brands this year hoping the exclusivity will be enough to drive people to its stores over the competition which includes Amazon.VIDEO4:5704:57Bed Bath & Beyond CEO on launch of eight new owned brands in 2021Squawk on the StreetLast month it debuted Nestwell which sells bed and bath items. Haven a spa-inspired bath brand will launch next week.Bed Bath & Beyond has said it expects its private-label sales will grow to represent 30% of its business within three years up from about 10% from today. The company said these efforts should also help boost its profitability.As the year progresses Bed Bath & Beyond said it expects sequential improvement in profit margins. Its hope is that pressures from heightened freight costs which have impacted many retailers over the course of the pandemic will ease."In 2020 our mix of digital to stores was outsized" Tritton said. "A digital sale because of the shipping costs is always a little different. We\'re going to see that recalibrate in 2021."This year the company plans to buy back $325 million of its own stock up from $300 million last year. Its three-year repurchase authorization was increased to $1 billion from $825 million.Bed Bath & Beyond shares are up about 57% year to date as of Tuesday\'s market close. The company has a market cap is $3.4 billion.Find the full earnings press release from Bed Bath & Beyond here.\xe2\x80\x94CNBC\'s Courtney Reagan contributed to this reporting.VIDEO3:3803:38Nike Urban Outfitters Abercrombie and Fitch set to be teen favorite brandsPower LunchSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Nevertheless we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here).Donald Sussman Paloma PartnersDonald Sussman of Paloma PartnersAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Red Gobo | Search AdsWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdCost of Luxury Cruises in 2021 Is Turning HeadsCruise Prices In 2021 May Make Your Jaw Drop ReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamCoinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.5h agoReutersGold prices ease as equities rally outweighs softer dollarGold prices inched lower on Wednesday as a record rally in global equity markets offset support for bullion from a softer dollar and data showing a jump in U.S. inflation.Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1743 per ounce as of 1013 GMT."Gold reacted positively to the U.S. inflation data because bond yields were down and the dollar was also weaker and so that certainly lend support to gold" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.10h agoReutersTaiwan says its chip firms will adhere to new U.S. rules blacklisting China supercomputing entitiesTaiwan said on Wednesday its chip companies will adhere to U.S. rules after Washington added seven Chinese supercomputing entities last week to an economic blacklist and after a Taipei-based chipmaker halted orders from one of the entities named.The U.S. Commerce Department said the seven Chinese entities were "involved with building supercomputers used by China\'s military actors its destabilizing military modernisation efforts and/or weapons of mass destruction programs."Companies or others listed on the U.S. Entity List are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.11h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2TRDR VenturesWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdHave Your Portfolio Ready for 2021 Market ChangesThe expert who guided over 4000 people helps prepare you for 2021 changes.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

BloombergTikTok Founder\'s $60 Billion Fortune Places Him Among The World\'s Richest People(Bloomberg) -- Just last year the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable startup ByteDance Ltd. was being squeezed from all sides.The Trump administration wanted the Chinese firm which owns the ubiquitous TikTok video-sharing platform to get rid of assets. Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d agoBloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider.

[+] merchandise retail stores is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesBed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday April 14th. We expect the home goods retailer likely to see little movement due to mixed fiscal Q4 results with revenues beating expectations but earnings falling short. Bed Bath & Beyond has shed all of its non-core segments in order to prioritize its survival in the retail market. In fact the Covid-19 crisis caused the retailer to rely on its e-commerce platform as people used their time at home to spruce up their interiors. This resulted in an exponential 82% growth in digital sales in first nine months of 2020 which more than offset store declines of 37%. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 as well. That said the company still depends on its massive turnaround strategy as it has been struggling with margin pressure and declining store traffic amid competition from e-commerce and omnichannel competitors in recent years.Our forecast indicates that Bed Bath & Beyond\xe2\x80\x99s valuation is around $30 a share which is in line with the current market price. Look at our interactive dashboard analysis on Bed Bath & Beyond\xe2\x80\x99s Pre-Earnings: What To Expect in Fiscal Q4? for more details.(1) Revenues expected to be ahead of consensus estimatesTrefis estimates Bed Bath & Beyond\xe2\x80\x99s Q4 2020 revenues to be around $2.7 Bil 3% ahead of the consensus estimate. In the first nine months of fiscal 2020 its revenue declined 18% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t disclose its comps growth in the first quarter due to pandemic-related store closures but its comps rose 6% y-o-y in the Q2 their first gain in four years and increased another 2% in the Q3. For the full year we expect Bed Bath & Beyond Revenues to decline 17% y-o-y to $9.3 billion.Bed Bath & Beyond has shed all of its non-core segments selling off its tchotchkes outlet PersonalizationMall.com the online flash sale site One Kings Lane ancillary home goods businesses Cost Plus World Market and Christmas Tree Shops. The company is going to focus solely on its namesake stores baby care chain buybuy baby and personal care outlet Harmon Face Values.2) EPS likely to miss the consensus markBed Bath & Beyond\xe2\x80\x99s Q4 2020 earnings per share are expected to come in at 27 cents per Trefis analysis 13% lower than the consensus estimate of 31 cents. The retailer\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to reduce product costs limit markdowns and optimize distribution costs started to bear fruit in Q2 itself. In the first nine months of 2020 Bed Bath & Beyond also reduced operating expenses by 17% compared to the prior-year period. This enabled it to post earnings per share of -$1.29 compared to a loss of $4.40 during the same period in the previous year.MORE FOR YOUCoinbase Is Not Worth $100 Billion But Its Stock Could Double On Direct ListingPalantir Technologies Stock Could Fall 17%Are Hedge Funds Predicting A Stock Market Crash?It should be noted that the company continues to see margin pressures due to increased digital fulfillment costs. To add to that the company already faces brutal competition from low-margin online pure-play retailers such as WayfairWand HomeGoods. Overall cost cuts and improvement in product assortments and pricing can only partially offset the company\xe2\x80\x99s current headwinds. As a result the company will likely struggle to return to profitability for the full year of 2020. We expect the company\xe2\x80\x99s EPS to come in at a loss of just over $1 for the full year 2020.(3) Stock price estimate below the current market priceGoing by our Bed Bath & Beyond\xe2\x80\x99s Valuation with a Revenue Per Share estimate of around $74.79 and P/S multiple of 0.4x in fiscal 2020 this translates into a price of around $30 almost in line with the current market price.The home goods retailer also presented a three-year outlook wherein it intends to boost profitability through better inventory management and debt reduction ultimately resulting in $500 million to $1 billion in cumulative free cash flow from now through the end of 2023. Although the company seems to have taken steps in the right direction everything will hinge on its ability to maintain its sales levels over the long term. For now there are too many potential stumbling blocks.E-commerce is eating into retail sales but this might be an investment opportunity.

Goldman Sachs\xc2\xa0reports before the market opens on Wednesday at 0730 EST / 1230 UK time. Goldman traditionally\xc2\xa0leads the other investment banks so it will be closely watched. Commentary around the recent Archegos developments and trading volumes going forward after the retail frenzy will also be key. It is importnant to focus on\xc2\xa0how each measures up what is expected and what the shares have done in the past.While Goldman is the big headline-grabber on Wednesday there is a return to the retail memes when Bed Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY) reports. Bed Bath & Beyond captured the zeitgeist in January as a member of the meme stock brigade and saw sharp volatility. Results could provide some swings. BBBY stock earnings are released before the open with no time confirmed. The post-release earnings conference call is scheduled for 0800 EST / 1300 UK time.Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) completes Wednesday\'s lineup. WFC reports before the market opens.Analysts have penciled in some pretty tough acts to follow for the upcoming quarter. Refinitiv data shows Q1 earnings are expected to rise 25% from a year earlier. This is a like-for-like comparison as the pandemic effects had not fed through. Refinitiv also shows that so far 21\xc2\xa0of S&P 500 companies have already reported Q1 2021 earnings and 81% have beaten\xc2\xa0analyst forecasts.The chart from Refinitiv below shows the tech sector having the largest number of upward revisions to estimates while the financial sector is close behind.Goldman Sachs stockGoldman (NYSE: GS) is to report before the market opens on Wednesday. Analyst consensus for earnings per share (EPS) is $10.22\xc2\xa0with revenue of $12.61\xc2\xa0billion. Goldman Sachs\xc2\xa0has strongly surprised to the upside over the last three quarterly earnings releases. EPS outperformance was 61% for Q4 2020 74% for Q3 2020 and 65% for Q2 2020. It is not since this quarter last year that Goldman Sachs\xc2\xa0missed estimates and even then only marginally.Goldman shares actually dropped on the last earnings date January 19. Despite EPS beating by 61% GS shares fell by over 2%. GS shares rallied on the earnings release from $300 to $310 but fell for the remainder of the pre-market and regular session. It was a similar situation for Q3 2020. EPS beat estimates by a huge margin 74% but Goldman shares fell after the announcement.GS\xc2\xa0said in the aftermath of the last results that capital market\xc2\xa0activity would likely slow down and that Goldman\'s consumer business subsidiary Marcus was taking longer to turn a profit. Commentary again around Marcus consumer lending will be watched despite that currently\xc2\xa0it accounts for less than 3% of Goldman\'s revenue.Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report earnings at 0730 EST / 1230 UK / 1330 CETWells Fargo stockWells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) will also report on Wednesday before the market opens. WFC is expected to announce EPS of $0.70 and revenue of $17.5 billion. Wells Fargo stock has not had the same stellar track record of outperformance that Goldman Sachs has shown. In fact WFC has missed all expectations for 2020 barring the final quarter when it marginally beat estimates. Wells Fargo released Q4 2020 results on January 15 when it beat EPS by 7% and revenue\xc2\xa0missed expectations by just 1%. However the Wells Fargo stock price took the news badly and closed down nearly 8% post-release.In mid-October 2020 Wells Fargo released its previous numbers. On this occasion EPS missed by 6.6% while revenue beat by 5%. The stock again reacted negatively and closed 6%\xc2\xa0lower.Wells Fargo Bank is due to report earnings before the market opens on Wednesday but no exact time has been released.Bed Bath & Beyond stockBed Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY) is expected to\xc2\xa0also release earnings\xc2\xa0before the market opens on Wednesday. It would seem\xc2\xa0nobody fancies working late on Wednesday.BBBY earnings are expected to show EPS of $0.31 and revenue of $2.6 billion. The last number of earnings releases from Bed Bath & Beyond have all been volatile with wide beats and misses versus consensus expectations. BBBY has been one of the meme retail favourites for 20201 and the shares have also been highly volatile. The last set of results for Bed Bath & Beyond were released on January 7. The results were disappointing as both EPS and revenue missed Wall Street analyst expectations. BBBY shares dropped 10% after the earnings release. This was just before retail interest in the shares really took off so expect more volatility this time if earnings miss or beat by a large margin.BBBY shares appreciated from around the $20 level to a high of $53.90 during peak R/WallStreetBets fervour. BBBY shares have since retreated to just under $30 as the retail traders found other stocks to trade and the overall volume of retail flow has decreased as the economy\xc2\xa0reopens.First Republic BankFinally on Wednesday First Republic Bank (FRC) reports earnings for Q1 2021\xc2\xa0before the market opens. First Republic will not grab as many headlines as the more high-profile names above but will still give clues for the retail banking sector. First Republic Bank is expected to report EPS of $1.54 and revenue of $1.09 billion.At the time of writing the author has no position in any stock mentioned in this article and no business relationship with any company mentioned.

BBBY is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results on Apr 14 2021. The leading specialty retailer is likely to deliver revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 27 cents suggesting a decline of 29% from the year-ago quarter\xe2\x80\x99s reported figure.

Price and EPS SurpriseBed Bath & Beyond Inc. price-eps-surprise | Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. QuoteKey Points to NoteBed Bath & Beyond is one of the few retailers that have been benefiting from consumers\xe2\x80\x99 shift to online shopping amid the pandemic. The company has been witnessing robust sales trends in the digital platform since fourth-quarter fiscal 2019. Its digital unit has been gaining from Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and contactless curbside-pickup facilities. Additionally strong digital sales have been more than offsetting the in-store comps decline aiding comparable sales (comps) growth. The persistence of positive trends in comps and digital business is likely to have bolstered the company\xe2\x80\x99s top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.Additionally its efforts to expedite the delivery and supply-chain network through the conversion of Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in the United States and Canada into regional fulfillment centers have been paying off. Also it partnered with Shipt to launch a same-day delivery service in its namesake and buybuy baby stores which is likely to have aided sales. Gains from these actions are also likely to get reflected in the company\xe2\x80\x99s robust digital sales results for the to-be-reported quarter.Also stringent cost-cutting actions and strong financial position are likely to have contributed to bottom-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.Nonetheless the company is expected to have witnessed continued COVID-related headwinds like dismal store traffic significant shipping constraints and increased freight expenses. Also adversities in the BABY business due to COVID-19 as well as the sale of non-core businesses and store closures are likely to have impacted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter\xe2\x80\x99s earnings call management predicted that the aforementioned headwinds will weigh on its fiscal fourth-quarter top line. In fact total enterprise comps are envisioned to be nearly flat year over year with net sales expected to decline at a double-digit rate. Moreover in-store traffic is likely to remain drab in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Bed Bath & Beyond this time around.

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamCoinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.5h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2TRDR VenturesWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdAndrews New Pick Is A Must For Your 2021 PortfolioAndrews top company pick for 2021... and why it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a boom year for investors.

We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2History A2ZWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdEpic Clothing Fails That Are Too Good To Be TrueHard to believe these clothing fails actually exist ReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d agoBloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider.
