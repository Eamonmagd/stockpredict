b'Who Has Been Selling iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) Shares?', b'2 days ago', b"So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT). Do Insider Transactions...Who Has Been Selling iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT) Shares? - Simply Wall St News It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares.The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance.So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT).Do Insider Transactions Matter?It is perfectly legal for company insiders including board members to buy and sell stock in a company.However such insiders must disclose their trading activities and not trade on inside information.We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing.But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.For example a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company\xe2\x80\x99s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.See our latest analysis for iRobotThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At iRobotIn the last twelve months the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director Michael Bell sold US$321k worth of shares at a price of US$80.24 per share.That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$117 an insider wanted to cash in some shares.As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.However while insider selling is sometimes discouraging it's only a weak signal.This single sale was 65% of Michael Bell's stake.Michael Bell was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.By clicking on the graph below you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! NasdaqGS:IRBT Insider Trading Volume April 12th 2021 For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership of iRobotI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders.Usually the higher the insider ownership the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.iRobot insiders own about US$50m worth of shares. That equates to 1.5% of the company.While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About iRobot Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded iRobot shares in the last quarter.We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by iRobot insiders.The modest level of insider ownership is at least some comfort.In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on it's beneficial to identify the risks facing iRobot.When we did our research we found 3 warning signs for iRobot (1 is concerning!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies. For the purposes of this article insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Will You Be One of Them?On April 20 at 7 p.m. ET Louis Navellier and Matt McCall will reveal an event that\xe2\x80\x99s about to rock the stock market and how you could use it to beat the markets by nearly 11X.Tue April 20 at 7:00PM ETDaysHoursMinutesSecondsRegister Here FreeHome / Expert Stock Picks to Buy Now / Stocks to Buy / The 3 Most Interesting AI and Robotics Stocks TodaySource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.comIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to find a sector where artificial intelligence and robots will not see increased applications in the coming years. Agriculture retail shopping manufacturing and gaming are just some examples. One thing that touches each one of them is their viability as robotics stocks plays.It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising therefore that the AI and robotics market are expected to grow at a CAGR of 28% through fiscal 2026 and it\xe2\x80\x99s likely strong growth will sustain beyond this period.Even if companies in the AI and robotics industry follow the industry growth rate the outlook for these companies is bright so it makes sense to consider some exposure to robotics stocks.Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about three robotics stocks that stand to benefit from positive industry tailwinds.iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT)Revolution Acceleration Acquisition (NASDAQ:RAAC)Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN)Robotics Stocks: iRobot Corporation (IRBT)Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.comIRBT stock is possibly the top name to consider among robotics stocks. The stock has witnessed a strong rally adding nearly 150% in the last year. With short interest at 20% of free float I would be cautious at current levels. However the stock is worth accumulating on corrections.As an overview iRobot is a consumer robot company with a primary focus on the home robot cleaning category. For fiscal 2020 the company reported revenue growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis to $1.4 billion. For this year the company has guided for 14% to 17% revenue growth.The company believes that mid to high top-line growth is sustainable in FY2022 and beyond. This seems very likely considering the point that the company is looking at product diversification. Geographical diversification is another factor that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to keep revenue growth robust.Focus on innovation sets the iRobot apart from its peers. The company has more than 200 patents in robot artificial intelligence and home understanding. Overall iRobot is positioned for steady growth in the coming years. A potential correction would be a good opportunity to accumulate IRBT stock.Revolution Acceleration Acquisition (RAAC)Source: Dmitry Demidovich/ShutterStock.comRAAC stock would be among my top picks among special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that are robotics stocks plays.Recently Revolution Acceleration announced a business combination agreement with Berkshire Grey. The latter is a \xe2\x80\x9cpure-play robotics company offering fully integrated artificial intelligence-based software and hardware solutions.\xe2\x80\x9dAs a matter of fact the company\xe2\x80\x99s Founder and CEO Tom Wagner previously served as a chief technology officer at iRobot. Berkshire Grey is focused on e-commerce package handling and grocery companies. The company provides comprehensive and coordinated AI-enabled robotics to end clients in these industries. In particular for warehouse operations.Berkshire Grey estimates that only 5% of warehouses are currently automated. This presents a big opportunity for growth in the coming years. For the year the company expects revenue of $59 million. Further top-line is guided at $927 million for FY2025. The company is therefore positioned for strong growth in the next few years.On the flip-side Berkshire Grey expects to be adjusted EBITDA positive only in FY2024. However it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that EBITDA margin is guided at 25% for FY2025. Once top-line growth accelerates significantly the business can deliver healthy cash flows.Once the business combination is closed Berkshire Grey will have net cash of $507 million. With ample financial flexibility the company seems well-positioned to accelerate growth.Robotics Stocks: Nuance Communications (NUAN)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comNUAN stock has been in a steady uptrend and currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 60.However Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that the stock has a price target of $65. This would imply about a 45% upside from current levels (around $45).As an overview Nuance Communication is in the business of conversational AI focused on healthcare. The company\xe2\x80\x99s key product is Nuance Dragon Ambient Experience (DAX) which they claim addresses\xc2\xa0a key challenge of clinical documentation in the healthcare industry. That is it takes detailed notes during the visit to which the physician can refer later.The company had expansion plans beyond the U.S. to 14 other countries. This could be a potential game-changer in terms of top-line growth.It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the company has continued to report negative top-line growth on a year-on-year basis. However the stock has trended higher.The reason is the possible growth outlook in the next few years with a market-disrupting AI technology.Another reason for the stock remaining firm is the company\xe2\x80\x99s recurring revenue model. For the current year the company expects ARR in the range of $510 to $540 million.By FY2023 recurring revenue is expected at $955 million (mid-range of guidance). Clearly as ARR accelerates the company is well-positioned to generate robust cash flows.On the date of publication\xc2\xa0Faisal Humayun\xc2\xa0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.Faisal Humayun is a senior research analyst with 12 years of industry experience in the field of credit research equity research and financial modeling.

Here are two companies you may want to\xc2\xa0consider.This article was originally written by MyWallSt. Read more market-beating insights from the MyWallSt team here.iRobot: Bull vs BeariRobot\xc2\xa0(NASDAQ: IRBT) is a $3 billion company that designs and builds consumer robots \xe2\x80\x94 namely automated vacuum and mops for households. The business had an impressive 2020 with its stock growing 59%. The company has acknowledged how consumer attitudes within the space have changed. The concept of having an automated robot doing household chores has become more accepted but the business still continues to innovate and further develop its high-end products making it a consumer robotics market leader.iRobot is determined to stay at the top spending almost $160 million on research and development in 2020 alone and this company mindset is attractive when it comes to long-term investing. iRobot has been constantly upgrading features on its existing products with its latest Roombas being equipped with advanced three-stage cleaning personalized cleaning routines and self-emptying features.Full-year 2020 revenue for iRobot rose to $1.43 billion an 18% increase over the previous year. Q4 2020 was a high-expansion quarter with the company seeing 27% international growth with U.S. growth rising 28% Japanese growth rising 39% and EMEA growth at 26%. The pandemic boosted iRobot\xe2\x80\x99s higher-margins e-commerce segment with direct-to-consumer revenue rising 114%.As for the company\xe2\x80\x99s bear case there have been some short-term worries. The business saw a 25% tariff on all of its products due to the U.S.-China trade war with an expected full-year cost of around $42 million for iRobot. It has fought back by increasing production in Malaysia. iRobot also suffers from some near-term uncertainty as the aftermath of the pandemic might hit consumer spending which could see sales slump in 2021.Raytheon Technologies: Bull vs BearRaytheon\xc2\xa0(NYSE: RTX) is a technology and innovation leader specializing in robotics defense aerospace civil government and cybersecurity solutions. Raytheon has recently been working with robotics to find innovative ways to assist soldiers fighting on the ground with autonomous aircraft such as drones.The company saw its share price cut in half at the start of 2020 mostly due to its high stakes in the crippled aviation industry but its share price is beginning to recover. Raytheon has been investing heavily in robotics and luckily it has its substantial defense industry exposure keeping it afloat and softening the blow to its commercial aerospace segment. Raytheon\xe2\x80\x99s share price is a bargain right now compared to pre-pandemic and as the aviation industry is expected to begin to recover so should Raytheon. Whilst we could be waiting some time for the stock to fully recover investors still benefit from a 2.9% dividend.Raytheon had a tough 2020 with sales topping $16.4 billion and adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) reaching $0.74. The company is banking on the aviation industry to come back strong forecasting sales to almost quadruple in 2021 to around $64 billion and an adjusted EPS of around $3.55. If this pulls off it would make Raytheon a great investment. The obvious bear case here is that if the reopening of the global economy and aviation industry does not go to plan we may see another difficult year for Raytheon.MyWallSt gives you access to over 100 market-beating stock picks and the research to back them up.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry\xe2\x80\x99s outlook for 2021 and some of the major growth catalysts for robotics stocks and go directly to 5\xc2\xa0Best Robotics Stocks For 2021. Governments and organizations around the world have been soliciting proposals for increased automation in industry and management as they aim to implement the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic on a large scale. The robotics industry forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 26% till 2025 is set to see record profits. Dublin-based firm Research and Markets reveals that global robotic sales stood at $40 billion in 2019 with the number set to increase in 2021. Growth Catalysts for Robot Stocks Even though robots have been around since the 1960s and there has been a steady uptick in robotics sales over the past few decades the automation revolution has picked up in the last ten years as technological breakthroughs rising labor costs and decreasing equipment costs force industries to turn towards robotics. According to global management consultancy McKinsey the main drivers triggering investment in automation also include improved capabilities of robots unburdening of employees and brand perceptions around new technologies.McKinsey research outlines that some industries stand to gain from these changes than others. For example the automotive electronic and pharma industries are set to witness a dramatic increase in investment towards automation. Some of these predictions are already coming true as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk aggressively pushes for automation of the electric carmaker as demand for electric vehicles rises globally. Even Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has moved towards automation in electronics manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 In addition to these changes on an industrial scale robots are fast penetrating daily life as well. A report published in the Harvard Business Review claims that automations are now disrupting the retail business as companies deploy robots to meet consumer demands in retail stores. For example Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is already operating fully digital stories staffed by robots and machines only. Even hotels and home improvement outlets have turned their attention to the automation of their businesses and its benefits.\xc2\xa0 It is quite clear that the industry outlook for robotics is positive for the coming years but investors need to be cautious about the drives of change in the different industries where robotics plays an important part. For example automakers deploy robots for production flexibility whereas the electronics industry uses them for testing the quality of their products. The pharma industry invests for robot capabilities. Cost and compatibility are potential roadblocks to the growth of robots across the world. The robots market was valued at $26.3 billion in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the markets globally.\xc2\xa0 Many fear that robots would take away our jobs and add to the problems of the already-worsening economic situation that has clobbered even the elite hedge funds. The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand Insider Monkey\xe2\x80\x99s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\xe2\x80\x99s stock picks returned 197.2% vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

He launched his hedge fund in 1956 with $105100 in seed capital. Back then they weren\xe2\x80\x99t called hedge funds they were called \xe2\x80\x9cpartnerships\xe2\x80\x9d. Warren Buffett took 25% of all returns in excess of 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 For example S&P 500 Index returned 43.4% in 1958. If Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund didn\xe2\x80\x99t generate any outperformance (i.e. secretly invested like a closet index fund) Warren Buffett would have pocketed a quarter of the 37.4% excess return. That would have been 9.35% in hedge fund \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Actually Warren Buffett failed to beat the S&P 500 Index in 1958 returned only 40.9% and pocketed 8.7 percentage of it as \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d. His investors didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that he underperformed the market in 1958 because he beat the market by a large margin in 1957. That year Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund returned 10.4% and Buffett took only 1.1 percentage points of that as \xe2\x80\x9cfees\xe2\x80\x9d. S&P 500 Index lost 10.8% in 1957 so Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s investors actually thrilled to beat the market by 20.1 percentage points in 1957. Between 1957 and 1966 Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund returned 23.5% annually after deducting Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s 5.5 percentage point annual fees. S&P 500 Index generated an average annual compounded return of only 9.2% during the same 10-year period. An investor who invested $10000 in Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s hedge fund at the beginning of 1957 see his capital turn into $103000 before fees and $64100 after fees (this means Warren Buffett made more than $36000 in fees from this investor). As you can guess Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s #1 wealth building strategy is to generate high returns in the 20% to 30% range. We see several investors trying to strike it rich in options market by risking their entire savings. You can get rich by returning 20% per year and compounding that for several years. Warren Buffett has been investing and compounding for at least 65 years. So how did Warren Buffett manage to generate high returns and beat the market? In a free sample issue of our monthly newsletter we analyzed Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s stock picks covering the 1999-2017 period and identified the best performing stocks in Warren Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio.
