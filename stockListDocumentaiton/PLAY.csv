But the bull market may be entering a new phase as it turns two years old \xe2\x80\x94 an investing regime that requires a bit more defense."It\'s definitely hard to say that we\'re going to see 80% gains in the second year. But we think that it\'s even harder to say that the market is going to rally with the momentum it\'s had recently \xe2\x80\x94 for a few different reasons" says Callie Cox senior investment strategist at Ally Invest on Yahoo Finance Live.She explains that over the last three quarters we\'ve been in a "low expectations" market \xe2\x80\x94 one fueled by big earnings and economic beats. "[R]eal earnings growth has beaten estimates by 10 percentage points because estimates were that low. And going into Q1 estimates are high again ... [W]e think investors could get a little confused as they see real earnings growth come in that\'s not quite as high compared to estimates... So it\'s really like a mind shift that we\'re dealing with" says Cox.This is not a reason to get bearish \xe2\x80\x94 only to tame expectations for the next year of returns. According to Ally Invest calculations there have been nine times when the 12-month rolling return on the S&P 500 was 30% or more since 1950. According to Yahoo Finance calculations these periods yielded a median gain of 34% and an average gain of 40%. In the year following these returns all were positive (and no bull market has ever ended in year two notes Cox). However profits were more muted with a median return of 11% and average return of 13%. The S&P 500 is already up 9.7% this year."[I]t\'s typical for the bull market to lose a little bit of steam going into year two. And that\'s going back to the low expectations high growth kind of thing. Expectations start rising and makes it harder for the market to ... beat everybody\'s expectations. And that leaves a greater chance for disappointment. And to be clear again we\'re not calling for doom and gloom. We just think the market is due for a breather up in the next quarter or two" says Cox.Story continuesIf stock market returns are to come back in line within historical norms Ally recommends gaining exposure to more defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples.\xc2\xa0"We\'ve seen less of the recovery gains go to those sectors. And those are the types of sectors that can do well when the market kind of stagnates or if it sells off. Those are defensive. So investors typically rush to those areas" she says.S&P Select Consumer Staples SPDR Fund (XLP) and S&P Select Utilities SPDR Fund (XLU) vs. S&P 500 since the March 4 2021 recent bottom in the indexThe above chart shows that since the interim market bottom on March 4 the S&P 500 has gained 9.5%. The performance of the S&P Select Consumer Staples SPDR Fund (XLP) nearly matches it at 9.2% and S&P Select Utilities SPDR Fund (XLU) surpasses it clocking in at 10.6%.Cox doesn\'t believe investors should count out tech (XLK) either which staged a big comeback last week after lagging most of the year. "We\'re feeling a little less optimistic about tech just because it\'s gained so much. And in a high growth environment growth stocks like tech stocks typically don\'t do as well. But then again the market has surprised us a lot over the past year or so. We are optimistic on tech longer term" says Cox.2021 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingJared Blikre is an anchor and reporter focused on the markets on Yahoo Finance Live.

Verizon Wireless is the brand name for the company\'s wireless services which are available on all wireless networks in the United States. They offer wireless and wireline connectivity video and data services corporate communication technology surveillance and managed web services. Verizon Communications Inc. is a telecommunications conglomerate and a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They were incorporated in Delaware and have its headquarters at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan New York City. With over 150 million broadband subscribers as of April 2019 Verizon Wireless is the second-largest wireless telephone service provider in the United States. If you\'d invested 1000 in Verizon Communications Inc on April 13 2011 today the investment would be worth $2400.77. Your investment would have gone up with an annual rate of return of 9.13% and a total increase of 140.08%. Your total profit from this investment 10 years later would have been $1400.77. In 2021 Verizon expects its cellular service and other sales to rise by at least 2%. Affordable wireless services are expected to be the company\'s main revenue generator in the coming years.

The Cannacord analyst Jonathan Dorsheimer backed up his bold assertion by noting that Tesla is involved in more than just cars just like Apple does more than just make iPhones.The Apple-like spin is admittedly aggressive and maybe even a bit aspirational but such is the nature of Tesla. Investors either believe in the vision of Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s chief executiveElon Muskor they don\xe2\x80\x99t. So far it has paid to be a believer and the stock\xe2\x80\x99s Monday rally suggests that Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s investors are looking for new reasons to be evangelical. The reason to believe could come as early as April 26 when Tesla is scheduled to reports first-quarter earnings after the market closes. Should the stock surge investors can shout hallelujah. Should the stock stumble look for a baptism by fire. With Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s stock around $725 aggressive investors could consider buying Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s April $735 call options that expire April 30 for $37.50. If the stock is at $800 the call is worth $65. Should the stock be below the strike price at expiration the trade fails though the call could be adjusted within the options market to keep it alive.\xc2\xa0 During the past 52 weeks Tesla stock has ranged from $134.76 to $900.40. So far this year the stock is up about 3% compared with a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.The last time we mentioned Tesla was in early April just before the company reported first-quarter vehicle deliveries.\xc2\xa0 We then suggested that investors sell Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s May $500 or May $550 put options to trade delivery data when the stock was around $661.75. So far the trade has worked well. The May $500 puts are trading at $3.50 down from $11 and the May $550 puts are trading at $6.85 down from $20.\xc2\xa0 Securing profits is largely a matter of discipline. Some investors will secure profits with gains of 70% on the puts others will go for 90%. Still others will hold the puts until expiration because they are content acquiring the stock at the put strike price.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of which side of the options market appeals to you Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s earnings should be a key event and the sell-side analysts are likely to have more salacious comments to make.\xc2\xa0 Steven M.

Since the merger announcement TLRY stock and APHA shares have gone in different directions due to the merger arbitrage opportunity.Source: Jarretera / Shutterstock.comWhen the Aphria-Tilray merger was announced back in mid-December both pot stocks exploded.In terms of revenue the combination will create the biggest cannabis company in the world. So the enthusiasm surrounding the merger makes sense.In the year thus far Aphria stock is up 135.3% and TLRY gained 139.2%. Under the terms of the deal Aphria stockholders will receive 62% of the combined entity.Some made money by buying Aphria and shorting Tilray. However at this point the more interesting discussion is whether the combined entity will have the legs to run in an ailing industry.It has been struggling due to the Canadian cannabis market going through an essential round of bubble bursting.On that end I believe the merger ultimately creates an interesting stock that has a much better chance of competing in the Canadian cannabis sector while keeping an eye on the U.S. market.TLRY Stock Suffered With Cannabis SectorLet\xe2\x80\x99s face it. Before this merger was announced both Tilray and the wider cannabis segment were suffering. Gross margin operating margin net margin return on assets return on equity and ROIC is all in the red for TLRY.According to Refinitiv data the Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company has disappointed Wall Street analysts\xe2\x80\x99 consensus earnings estimates 10 times in the last 12 quarters. The company recently reported a negative EPS of 45 cents versus a consensus of negative 14.7 a miss of 206.1%.There are some bright spots though. For the full year 2020 total revenue jumped 26% to $210.5 million driven by international medical revenue and growth in its Canadian adult-use business.Out of the two companies Aphria is clearly the better company on operating metrics. Sales rose 235.8% over the last five years at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Growth in the top line hasn\xe2\x80\x99t translated to profitability as yet. But on every major operating metric the company is doing better than Tilray.APHA Stock Maintains Upper HandNo surprises Aphria has the upper hand in this deal. Shareholders will get a total of 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each of their Aphria shares and control the combined entity.Aphria\xe2\x80\x99s and Tilray\xe2\x80\x99s share prices will diverge in the run-up to the merger due to the market arbitrage opportunity. Basically a market arbitrage opportunity is when you simultaneously buy and sell securities to take advantage of a price difference.Usually when a merger is announced the target company\xe2\x80\x99s share price rises. The opposite occurs in the case of the acquiring company. The acquiring company has to pay a premium to purchase the target company often using debt to finance the acquisition.Combined Entity Will Be a Strong European PlayerAfter the merger the surviving entity will become the biggest cannabis company globally in terms of revenue.Wider marijuana decriminalization in the U.S. is imminent. Democrats have unified control of the White House Senate and House for the first time since 2010.At the moment neither Aphria nor Tilray has a strong American presence. In contrast the European medicinal cannabis market and the Canadian recreational market represent the company\xe2\x80\x99s strongest market segments.That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a splash in the U.S. though. With greater size and scale it can make further inroads into the American market since that is the major lifeline for most cannabis aspirants at the moment.Although it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly large the Canadian market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold a candle to the California weed industry let alone the entire U.S.Hence the foray into America is a given and with the combination the merged entity has a better chance of performing well in the market.Bottom Line on Tilray StockFor now investors should keep taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. In the last three months alone shares have increased by 90%. During the same time Tilray stock is up 74.7%. The divergence will increase as we move closer to the merger.If you are bullish on the merger you can hold onto APHA stock post the combination. But I would take my profits after the merger closes and wait for a couple of earnings reports before deciding to put your capital back into the company.On the date of publication Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

As Coinbase the cryptocurrency exchange goes public on Wednesday financial advisers want you to remember the difference. With retail investor ranks swelling there\xe2\x80\x99s growing allure in finding and profiting off the next new thing.\xe2\x80\x9cWith retail investor ranks swelling there\xe2\x80\x99s growing allure in finding and profiting off the next new thing.\xe2\x80\x9dEnter CoinbaseCOINa platform with 56 million verified users that enables the purchase and sale of crytpocurrencies like BitcoinBTCUSD-0.13%and Ethereum which appear to just keep increasing in value. An obvious investment considering the expert take that cryptocurrency is at a \xe2\x80\x9ctipping point\xe2\x80\x9d right? Not necessarily. Do so with prudence say financial advisers. Experts say it\xe2\x80\x99s always been risky to invest in companies just as they are going public.For example without a track record to work off share prices can be speculative and retail investors who think they understand the brand might not value it the way institutional investors do. Now mix that with cyrptocurrency\xe2\x80\x99s volatility and consider the skepticism of some who say Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s valuation is \xe2\x80\x9cridiculously high.\xe2\x80\x9d That number ranges froom $50 billion to $150 billion and even experts who are bullish say the stock is \xe2\x80\x9cnot for the faint of heart.\xe2\x80\x9d (A Coinbase spokeswoman declined to comment ahead of the IPO.) The idea is to invest in an IPO with a small portion of money you\xe2\x80\x99re okay potentially losing. The question is how much? Here are a couple different answers.The numbers game One common refrain is devoting somewhere between 5% and 10% of investable assets to speculative investments or stocks. Others say the amount that you\xe2\x80\x99re OK if that isn\xe2\x80\x99t too glib a word seeing potentially evaporate should not be more than 1% of a portfolio for investors. Ron Guay of Rivermark Wealth Management in Sunnyvale Calif. tells his clients to cap their \xe2\x80\x9cplay money\xe2\x80\x9d at 10% \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s the same rule he follows himself.\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The less your net worth the lower the percent of play money you should cut loose.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 Theresa Morrison founding partner at Beckett Collective in Tucson Ariz.Daniel Johnson of RE|Focus Financial Planning in Winston Salem N.C. says he\xe2\x80\x99s all for people putting money into the companies that interest them because many times the investment works out on companies they know and understand.But he\xe2\x80\x99s all for diversification too. Keeping the investment in any one company below 5% is a good bet he said. But the same numbers do not fit everyone according to Theresa Morrison founding partner at Beckett Collective in Tucson Ariz. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose your \xe2\x80\x98play money\xe2\x80\x99 then don\xe2\x80\x99t play\xe2\x80\x9d she said. That money might be 1% to 2% of invested assets she said.\xe2\x80\x9cThe less your net worth the lower the percent of play money you should cut loose\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cConversely the more flush your net worth the higher percent of play money you can allocate but only up to a point.\xe2\x80\x9dThe no-numbers approach In the lead up to Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s direct listing Chris Struckhoff founder of Lionheart Capital Management in Orange County Calif. said he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking to some clients who want to buy Coinbase shares.\xe2\x80\x9cThey have these dollar signs in their eyes\xe2\x80\x9d he said. These people view Coinbase stock as rocket fuel to meet their financial goals but \xe2\x80\x9clike with anything the faster you try to go the more likely you\xe2\x80\x99re going to trip yourself up\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Struckhoff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell his clients to buy the stock or wait. He thinks about the idea of play money without applying hard-and-fast numbers. He does this by thinking backwards with clients. They start by remembering the financial goals a person has \xe2\x80\x94 a house a boat a nest egg or something else. Then they look at the financial wiggle room someone has to devote to something like a Coinbase play.What about just buying cryptocurrency? Given the price surge in crytpocurrencies like Bitcoin and EthereumETHUSD+2.22%some say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth going straight to the source and buying virtual currency instead. But again they say not to go overboard.\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You can either search for gold (own crypto) or you can sell shovels (own Coinbase stock).\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 Graciano Rubio of Infinity Financial Planning in Los Banos Calif.For example Vrishin Subramaniam the founder of CapitalWe a financial planning firm focused on millennial investors and younger recommends putting somewhere between 2% and 5% of net worth in cryptocurrency. If someone wants to buy into Coinbase Subramaniam would advise folding this investment into the 5% cyrptocurrency investment basket. Going forward \xe2\x80\x9cwe can increase that allocation for listed securities after a couple quarters once we have more information in the public domain\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause Coinbase and other platforms have made it convenient to own cryptocurrency I think the best way to gain cryptocurrency exposure is through direct ownership of cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d said Graciano Rubio of Infinity Financial Planning in Los Banos Calif. There\xe2\x80\x99s a metaphor for the moment that\xe2\x80\x99s wrapped up California\xe2\x80\x99s own Gold Rush during the mid-1800s. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can either search for gold (own crypto) or you can sell shovels (own Coinbase stock). They each have unique risks and upside but both can be a successful strategy to profit from cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d he said.My parents made my sister executor of their $4 million estate and joint owner of their bank accounts.

With a long-awaited new CEO Pat Gelsinger installed and with plans to build chip fabrication (FABs) plants directly in the U.S. changes the narrative as a U.S. infrastructure play. This has bolstered sentiment and performance with shares out rising over 37% year-to-date (YTD) not only outperforming but lifting the Nasdaq 100. The Biden infrastructure package seeks to bolster U.S. supply chains from rare earth materials clean energy to semiconductors. Considering 80% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s semiconductor production is manufactured by two foreign companies Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung Electronics (OTCMARKETS: SSLNF). The rollout of it\xe2\x80\x99s much delayed Ice Lake-SP chips and plans for Meteor Lake and new research collaboration with IBM (NYSE: IBM) indicates the reawakening of the sleeping giant. Prudent investors looking to get exposure in a U.S. semiconductor infrastructure play can monitor shares of Intel for opportunistic pullback levels.Company Guidance UpdateOn March 23 2021 Intel raised its Q1 2021 EPS guidance above its prior guidance for $1.10 versus consensus analyst estimates of $1.11. The Company sees it Q1 2021 quarterly revenues for the month ending in March 2021 exceeding the prior guidance of $17.5 billion versus $17.59 billion consensus analyst estimates. However the Company trimmed full-year 2021 EPS guidance to come in around $4.55 versus consensus estimates for $4.74 and lowered full-year 2021 revenues to come in at approximately $72 billion versus $73.03 billion analyst estimates. While Q1 2021 strength was driven by continued strong notebook demand the industry wide shortage of third-party components and entity list uncertainty was responsible for the trimming of estimates. CEO Gelsinger stated \xe2\x80\x9c2021 is a transitional year as we accelerate Intel\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory invest in our future and improve out execution. We\xe2\x80\x99re working aggressively with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique manufacturing capabilities to solve for industry-wide component shortages and outperform this guide.\xe2\x80\x9dIDM 2.0On March 23 2021 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger unveiled the Company\xe2\x80\x99s integrated device manufacturing model known as IDM 2.0. The Company plans to construct two new fabs in Arizona at a cost of $20 billion. This will create 3000 permanent high-tech high wage jobs over 3000 construction jobs and approximately 15000 local long-term jobs. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo participated in the IDM 2.0 event. CEO Gelsinger summed it up \xe2\x80\x9cWe are excited to be partnering with the state of Arizona and the Biden administration on incentives to spur this type of domestic investment.\xe2\x80\x9dIntel Foundry ServicesIntel plans to become a major player and provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe to serve customers globally. The newest fab Fab 42 at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler AZ became fully operational processing 10nm chips in 2020. The two newly planned fabs will also reside at the Ocotillo campus with construction planned to commence later this year. The fabs will be part of a new standalone business Intel Foundry Services (IFS) led by semiconductor veteran Dr. Randhir Thakur. The new business will differentiate itself from competitors offering process packaging and committed capacity in the U.S. and Europe. Intel\xe2\x80\x99s IP portfolio is available for customer including x86 cores ARM and RISC-V ecosystem Ips. The Company has already received \xe2\x80\x9cstrong enthusiasm and statements of support from across the industry.\xe2\x80\x9d The Company also expects to tape in the compute tile for its first 7nm client CPU Meteor Lake in Q2 2021. The downplaying of full-year 2021 guidance may be an attempt to set the bar low heading however the market is clinging to the infrastructure and turnaround narrative with extremely positive sentiment. Prudent investors will need to administer patience avoiding the urge to chase entries.INTC Opportunistic Pullback LevelsUsing the rifle charts on the monthly and weekly time frames provides a broader view of the playing field for INTC shares. The monthly rifle chart is uptrending with a rising 5-period moving average (MA) support at $59.67 with monthly upper Bollinger Bands (BBs) near the $72.03 Fibonacci (fib) level. The monthly stochastic is still rising through the 60-band. The weekly rifle chart triggered a market structure low (MSL) buy trigger above $55.95 while the monthly market structure high (MSH) sell triggers under $53.60. The weekly rifle chart has an uptrend powered by a stochastic mini pup flushing shorts higher towards the weekly upper BBs near the $74.58 fib. Shares are nearing the pre-pandemic highs which will either form a double-top or a breakout. Prudent investors can monitor for opportunistic pullback levels at the $65.29 fib $63.53 fib $60.58 fib $58.51 fib and the $55.95 fib. The upside trajectories range from the $78.15 fib up towards the $88.03 fib level.\xc2\xa0Featured Article:How is an ETF different from a mutual fund?More from EntrepreneurOur Franchise Advisors are here to help you throughout the entire process of building your franchise organization!Schedule a FREE one-on-one session with a Franchise AdvisorChoose one of our programs that matches your needs budget and timelineLaunch your new franchise organizationLearn MoreDiscover the franchise that\xe2\x80\x99s right for you by answering some quick questions aboutWhich industry you\xe2\x80\x99re interested inWhy you want to buy a franchiseWhat your financial needs areWhere you\xe2\x80\x99re locatedAnd moreFind Your Franchise MatchTry a risk-free trial of Entrepreneur\xe2\x80\x99s BIZ PLANNING PLUS powered by LivePlan for 60 days:Get step-by-step guidance for writing your planGain inspiration from 500+ sample plansUtilize business and legal templatesAnd much moreStart My PlanLatest on EntrepreneurCompanyAdvertiseBrand LicensingHelp CenterEntrepreneur Media DepartmentsStaffContributeReprints & LicensingProductsFranchisePodcastsPublish Your BookEntrepreneur MerchandiseEditionsUnited StatesIndiaAsia PacificMiddle EastEuropeEspa\xc3\xb1olGeorgiaSouth AfricaGet the MagazineJoin Our NewsletterI understand that the data I am submitting will be used to provide me with the above-described products and/or services and communications in connection therewith.I confirm that I am over the age of 16 and consent the above-described data and its use by Entrepreneur Media Inc.SubmitTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCookies PolicyHelp CenterSite MapCopyright \xc2\xa9 2021 Entrepreneur Media Inc.

The theme is up by about 9% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 10% over the same period. The theme has also returned about 45% since the end of 2019 compared to a return of about 28% on the S&P 500.While EVs are no doubt the future investing in OEMs is somewhat tricky in our view. Pure play EV names such as Tesla and Nio have grown quickly with well received products but their stocks look pricey after rallying by over 5x and 13x respectively over the last year. On the other side automotive industry incumbents such as GM and Volkswagen are also investing large sums in electrifying their line-ups but it is not clear that this will compensate for eventual declines in gasoline vehicle sales as the playing field is getting more crowded. The barriers to entry into the EV market are not too high and many new players are looking to enter the market. For example Chinese smartphone behemoth Xiaomi plans to invest $10 billion in developing EVs. Now total volumes in the auto market are unlikely to increase due to EVs (it could even decline as technology such as self driving and robo taxis gain traction) meaning that competition could be more intense due to a larger number of players. Considering this EV supplier stocks could be a relatively safe way to play the broader electrification of the auto industry.Within our theme of EV supplier stocks BorgWarnerBWA a company best known for its transmission systems has emerged the strongest performer with its stock rising by about 20% year-to-date. On the other side Albemarle one of the largest producers of lithium for EV batteries has fared the worst with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.[3/24/2021] Volkswagen & GM Are Doubling Down On EVs Will Suppliers Benefit?Our indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks - which includes stocks of companies that make EV components and raw materials for batteries - is up by about 4% year to date roughly in line with the S&P 500. The theme has also returned about 40% since the end of 2019 compared to a return of about 21% on the S&P 500. While some of the stocks in our theme have corrected a bit in recent weeks we think the long-term outlook is strong. Mainstream automakers are making big commitments of shifting to EVs quickly and this could help suppliers in the medium term. For example last week Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) outlined a plan to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest seller of EVs by 2025 at the latest with the intention to invest around 46 billion Euros (about $55 billion) to electrify its lineup. Separately in late January General Motors - the largest U.S. automaker - announced that it would launch 30 electric models by 2025 with plans to sell only EVs by 2035. Within our theme BorgWarner - a company best known for its transmission systems - has emerged as the strongest performer this year rising by about 15% year-to-date. On the other side Amphenol CorporationAPH a company that makes electrical and fiber-optic connectors has underperformed declining by about 4%.[2/25/2021] EV Supplier StocksOur indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks - which includes stocks of companies that make EV components and raw materials for batteries - has outperformed rising by 8.3% year-to-date versus 3.6% for the S&P 500. The theme has also returned about 45% since the end of 2019 compared to a return of about 20% on the S&P 500. Within our theme auto parts major AptivAPTVhas been the strongest performer this year rising by over 16% since early January driven by stronger than expected quarterly earnings while Amphenol Corporation a company that makes electrical and fiber-optic connectors has underperformed declining by about -2% year-to-date.MORE FOR YOUCoinbase Is Not Worth $100 Billion But Its Stock Could Double On Direct ListingPalantir Technologies Stock Could Fall 17%Are Hedge Funds Predicting A Stock Market Crash?So will the theme continue to outperform in the near-to-medium term? Yes we think so for a couple of reasons. Firstly regulations under the Biden Administration are likely to be favorable for green technologies including renewable energy and electric vehicles. Secondly mainstream automakers are making bigger commitments to electrification and this should drive up demand for EV suppliers. For example in late January General Motors - the largest U.S. automaker - announced that it would launch 30 electric models by 2025 with plans to sell only EVs by 2035. There are other market-specific factors that could help EV supplier stocks as well. With Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out investors are hoping for a quicker economic rebound moving money away from technology names that rallied big through the pandemic to more real-economy sectors including auto components and mining stocks. This could also help the companies in our theme.[Updated 12/29/2020]Our indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks - which includes stocks of companies that make EV components and raw materials for batteries - has fared quite well in recent weeks. Year-to-date gains for the theme are now up to 35% versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 15% over the same period. While the recent gains are driven partly by the optimism surrounding the Covid-19 vaccines investors are also likely looking at suppliers as a good way to play the rapidly expanding EV market without having to bet on pricey EV manufacturer stocks such as Tesla (up 7x this year) and Nio (up over 10x). Within our theme Albemarle - the largest producer of lithium for EV batteries - has been the strongest performer doubling year to date. The stock has rallied by over 60% over the last two months alone driven by an earnings beat and better than expected performance of its lithium business. On the other side BorgWarner a company best known for its transmission systems has seen its stock decline almost -10% year-to-date partly due to its exposure to mainstream automakers.[Updated 10/19/2020] Why Suppliers Might Be A Better Way to Play The Electric Vehicle MarketInvesting in the fast-growing electric vehicle market looks tricky at the moment. Pure-play EV stocks have rallied big this year and look overvalued. For instance Tesla is up 5x this year while China\xe2\x80\x99s Nio is up over 7x. On the other hand mainstream automakers who have been slowly transitioning to electric drivetrains could face financial challenges due to the disruption caused by Covid-19. Our indicative theme of Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks \xe2\x80\x93 which includes stocks of companies that make EV components and raw materials for batteries \xe2\x80\x93 could be a good way to play the growing electric vehicle market without having to bet on individual brands. The theme is up by about 9% year-to-date versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 8% over the same period. While Albemarle is the strongest performer in the theme up by about 30% BorgWarner stock is down by about -10%. Below is a bit more about these companies and how they\xe2\x80\x99ve fared so far this year.Albemarle is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of lithium for EV batteries. Most electric vehicles are powered by lithium-based batteries and it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that demand for the material will rise as EV adoption grows.

Investors in\xc2\xa0FSR stock like the company\xe2\x80\x99s product lineup and its audacious goals.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comThis has been reflected in strong investor and consumer interest in Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s EV offering. The company already has 14000 preorders for its flagship Ocean EV. Indeed an electric SUV selling at an expected retail price of $37499 sounds pretty great to me. (The SUV also looks fantastic).Accordingly Fisker represents a company with real growth potential though it is still very much a story stock right now.I think the company\xe2\x80\x99s unique approach to how it plans on bringing its Ocean EV to market is intriguing. I also think the company\xe2\x80\x99s move to come public via a SPAC makes more sense than with many of its competitors who may have benefited more from waiting longer to go public.By raising money quicker Fisker hopes it can bring its Ocean EV to market sooner. Indeed speed is the name of the game today as all EV players are itching to grab a bigger slice of this growing pie.7 Restaurant Stocks Worth a VisitThe optimism seen in FSR stock earlier this year appears to have dissipated somewhat. Since rising to an all-time high of more than $31 in first quarter shares of FSR can now be bought at a 50% discount. Indeed FSR is currently trading right around the levels it started the year at having given away all its gains.It appears investors are losing interest with post-SPAC plays right now. However here\xe2\x80\x99s why I think FSR stock is an interesting high-risk high-reward play for EV investors today.A Unique Business Model Is Enticing for FSR StockFisker is a relatively unique option in the EV space based on two aspects of the company\xe2\x80\x99s business model I find interesting.The first key differentiator is the company\xe2\x80\x99s model built around third-party production. Fisker has manufacturing agreements signed with\xc2\xa0Magna International\xc2\xa0(NYSE:MGA) and\xc2\xa0Foxconn\xc2\xa0to build out its EV fleet. Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s will therefore be taking a similar approach to that of\xc2\xa0Apple\xc2\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its quest to maximize profitability over time. Instead of building its own factories and infrastructure Fisker will be outsourcing these capital-intensive business activities hoping to reap higher returns on investor capital for shareholders.Secondly Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s unique leasing model is extremely intriguing to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought there is room for disruption in terms of how car buyers make their purchase. I mean Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s proposed price tag of $37500 (which is only $30000 after the $7500 federal EV tax credit) puts it in the affordable range for most buyers. However those aspirational EV buyers without the ability to borrow $30K have another option.Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s leasing model would require a $3000 down payment and a monthly lease cost of only $379 per month. Subscription-based revenue models are all the rage these days for obvious reasons. If Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s EV lineup strikes a chord with car buyers the cash flows that could potentially be generated ought to be enticing to investors.Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s Ocean model won\xe2\x80\x99t be available until at least 2022 so there\xe2\x80\x99s time to assess whether or not a position in this company makes sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s still a pre-revenue bet on some flashy photos and marketing material. That said I have to reiterate \xe2\x80\x93 I really\xc2\xa0like the look of its Ocean model and look forward to seeing what sort of additional offerings would be on the horizon.ConclusionFisker\xe2\x80\x99s high-risk high-reward nature reminds me a lot of\xc2\xa0Tesla\xc2\xa0(NADSAQ:TSLA) 10 years ago.On the one hand investors are buying into a story. Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s troubled past suggests success isn\xe2\x80\x99t guaranteed. Indeed there\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0no guarantee Fisker\xe2\x80\x99s EV offering will ever be available to be driven off the lot. The company\xe2\x80\x99s still got a ways to go to putting its cars/SUVs on the road. Accordingly there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant amount of execution risk in a stock like this.Additionally a valuation of $4.5 billion prices in a ton of growth. Fisker will need to do everything perfectly to justify its valuation today. Investors may be paying a 50% discount to the peak in FSR stock earlier this year. However it\xe2\x80\x99s still trading at a 50% premium to its IPO.Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m on the fence with this one. I think it could be worth a speculative position among growth investors thinking very long-term. That said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bet the farm on this one. Practicing proper portfolio sizing is important with speculative plays like this is extremely important.On the date of publication Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/fsr-stock-is-an-high-risk-high-reward-ev-play/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.

Until recently the company traded as Foley Trasimene Acquisition under the BFT stock ticker. However on Mar. 30 the SPAC successfully completed its merger and is now Paysafe and PSFE stock.Source: Sulastri Sulastri / Shutterstock.comMoreover while Paysafe is not the most-hyped SPAC of the year by any means it\xe2\x80\x99s actually one of the largest. The deal was worth $9 billion at its pro forma price making the company a pivotal player in the online payments and e-wallet space from day one.But size isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing Paysafe has going for it either. This is a company that is already profitable already sports credible backers and already has a compelling outlook moving forward. So for investors wanting exposure to online gaming and payments PSFE needs to be on your watchlist. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why.PSFE Stock: Far Better Than the Average SPACThe SPAC boom has brought a ton of companies to market over the past year. Some of these are good firms. Many however are not. In a rush like this a lot of mediocre goods make it to market. That\xe2\x80\x99s been most obviously true in the electric vehicle (EV) space but it holds true elsewhere too. In gaming for example there are now a bunch of companies with thin resumes that are issuing stock.Paysafe by contrast is a credible company with numerous accomplishments. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a new start-up. In fact it has been successful for so long that private-equity titan Blackstone (NYSE:BX) bought Paysafe for about $4 billion back in 2017. Blackstone is no slouch; they knew this was a solid business with good prospects and real cash flows.However as private equity likes to do Blackstone was looking to take some chips off the table. Enter Bill Foley a legend in the real-estate arena. Foley built Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF) into one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest residential title insurers. Since then he has gone on to many other merger and acquisition deals including building real-estate-focused data companies like Black Knight (NYSE:BKI) and\xc2\xa0Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS).Long story short Bill Foley is an accomplished and highly successful dealmaker. And now with his Foley Trasimene Acquisition SPAC he has taken Paysafe to market. While credible investors don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily ensure long-term success the fact that both Foley and Blackstone backed Paysafe makes it clear this name is a force to be reckoned with. That alone bodes well for PSFE stock.Already a Large Successful FirmThe other thing that makes PSFE stock stand out is that it represents an already successful business. Many SPACs in the gaming space are essentially new companies. With online sports betting just coming into existence as a legal market most firms don\xe2\x80\x99t have substantial revenues yet.Paysafe however is huge. The firm estimates that it will process just north of $100 billion in transactions in 2021. With an average 1.5% fee on transactions that\xe2\x80\x99d be $1.5 billion or more in 2021 revenues. The company earns a gigantic 63% gross margin and should thus bring in nearly $1 billion of gross profit annually on those transactions.Paysafe earns these figures because it has multiple ways to interact with consumers. In fact it has three primary sources of revenue.For one it has the second biggest online wallet globally. Sites such as Draftkings (NASDAQ:DKNG) use Paysafe for handling money transfers and custody. Additionally Paysafe is an acquiring merchant for places such as Draftkings meaning that it brings cash into their ecosystems in the first place.Finally though the company is big in digital cash solutions. Examples of that include payment for online services such as Fortnite which is owned by Epic Games or Twitch which is owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This is particularly the case for younger consumers that don\xe2\x80\x99t have credit cards.The company itself estimates that growth will be around 11% per year over the next four years (Page 9). And that may even be conservative. After all consider how fast names like Draftkings are growing. As those markets take off Paysafe will earn more and more revenues processing all those cash transactions. You can quibble about valuation for Paysafe to be sure but there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a great core business here.The VerdictDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong \xe2\x80\x94 Paysafe is not without risk. SPACs in general carry their downsides. Plus the online gaming space is rapidly evolving. Changing consumer preferences or government regulation could quickly transform the market. Specifically as gaming is legalized in more markets it will likely attract further competition from traditional banks and payments networks.All that said though as far as 2021\xe2\x80\x99s most interesting SPACs go Paysafe is near the top of the list. This is a large company that has already proven to be a dramatic success. And with its various lines of business Paysafe is quite diversified too. While more competition will surely come it has a first-mover advantage with a wallet that\xe2\x80\x99s in wide use. That should ensure that Paysafe and PSFE stock have a strong future ahead.On the date of publication Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Ian Bezek has written more than 1000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

The stock market has similarly reacted. The S&P 500 banks and energy indexes for example have both gained 26% while more defensive and interest-rate sensitive sectors have lagged behind. There has been a similar dispersion in Europe where the Stoxx automobile sector has jumped 24% while the real estate sector has inched up just 1%.Analysts at Equita an Italian brokerage say the trade isn\xe2\x80\x99t over just yet even as there has been a big dispersion in performance. Inflation in the U.S. could reach 3% in the second quarter and in Europe inflation could start accelerating later in the year or in 2022. The analysts expect the Federal Reserve and other central banks to keep interest rates very low and monetize debt and they also say rising prices will be mainly demand driven based on a solid recovery rather than supply driven as with the recent microchip shortage. In this scenario they continue to like financials as well as cyclical and commodity-related industrials. They expect long-duration assets like defensive and technology stocks underperforming. They highlighted three industrial plays: tractor makerCNH Industrialhydraulic equipment makerInterpumpand the savers share class in metals equipment makerDanieli.Two energy plays they say could benefit from reflation were integrated oil producerEniand steel pipe producerTenarisand they recommended bankIntesaasset managerBanca MediolanuminsurerUnipolfitness equipment makerTechnogymand tire makerPirelli.CloseHere Are 10 Italian Stocks to Play the Reflation TradeThe so-called reflation trade has played out across global markets with the yield on the U.FromToMessageSENDAn error has occurred please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toPrivacy NoticeCookie NoticeCopyright PolicyData PolicyYour Ad ChoicesSubscriber Agreement & Terms of UseBarron\'s ArchiveCopyright \xc2\xa92021 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

In the middle of February SOS stock had rocketed past the $15 area on a short squeeze before plunging back to reality near the $5 level. Now speculators have embraced it especially given the low stock price small float and high short interest.Source: ShutterstockMoreover both stock and option volume have exploded over the past few months. This increased volume provides the opportunity to speculate but in a lower-risk manner that still allows plenty of upside.When it comes to SOS forget the fundamentals. It has yet to show profit and revenue growth. The company initially provided emergency rescue services but it recently morphed into a cryptocurrency play likely to take advantage of the red-hot crypto space. The company description on Robinhood\xe2\x80\x99s website says it all:\xe2\x80\x9cSOS Ltd. is a holding company which provides marketing data technology and solutions to the emergency rescue services in China. It focuses on the research and development of big data cloud computing Internet of Things blockchain and artificial intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9cThat description has every buzzword you could imagine in describing the company. This smacks of the late 1990s when many small companies became internet incubators to take advantage of investor appetite. So the question is not how the party will end but how long the party can go on.The short interest with SOS is at an extreme by some accounts higher than 200%. The recent pump and dump from $4 to $15 then back to $4 in mid-February was evidence of a classic short squeeze.Recently InvestorPlace contributor Robert Larkin recently took a deep dive into the short-squeeze aspects here. SOS stock broke through the $6 level on Apr. 7 before the squeeze attempt failed. Now shares have fallen over the past few days closing at $5.25 on Friday.Technical Take on SOS StockSOS is actually starting to improve on a technical basis. The 9-day RSI has turned higher after reaching oversold levels. MACD has bounced off recent lows and is poised to generate a buy signal. Momentum has firmed and looks to be ready to head into positive territory.There is major support and a double bottom at the $4.20 area. A close back above the 20-day moving average at $6.08 could be the impetus for a further leg higher in SOS stock.Source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform from TD AmeritradeI tweeted about the insane option volume on April 7 with nearly 700000 calls trading on the day.Over 40000 April 6 $6 strike calls traded that day. More importantly this massive call buying juiced implied volatility (IV) on these options from $141.23 the day before to over $230 on April 7. Friday saw even more big time call buying with another 13000 contracts trading.Such high levels of implied volatility means option prices are extremely expensive. This favors option selling strategies when constructing trades. So to take a guardedly bullish stance on the potential for another short-term short squeeze a covered call strategy makes probabilistic sense.Trade IdeaBuy SOS stock and sell May $5 calls for a $4.10 net debit or better.Selling the May $5 calls reduces the downside by 20% while still leaving some overall upside appreciation open. Ideally SOS closes above $5 at May expiration.\xc2\xa0 In this instance your short call will be assigned to close out the trade for a 22% net return in 38 days.The May $5 calls have a 70 delta \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of 70 shares of stock. This means by selling these calls against your long stock (which has 100 delta) you reduce the exposure to just 30 deltas or 30 shares of stock.If SOS stock closes below $5 at May expiration additional calls can be sold against the remaining long stock to bring in more premium and further reduce the downside risk.On the date of publication Tim Biggam did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Anyone interested in finding out more about option-based strategies or for a weekly option and volatility newsletter can visit the\xc2\xa0Options and Volatility Newsletter\xc2\xa0website.Article printed from InvestorPlace Media https://investorplace.com/2021/04/lower-risk-way-to-play-potential-short-squeeze-sos-stock/.\xc2\xa92021 InvestorPlace Media LLCSponsored HeadlinesMore from InvestorPlaceStocks to BuyBelow $20 Opendoor Stock Is an Absolute Steal With 10X PotentialBy Luke LangoApr 12 2021Stocks to BuyCanaan Is a Bitcoin Mining Investment the Market Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Caught On To YetBy Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research StaffApr 13 2021Today's MarketWhat Will the Stock Market Do Today? 3 Big Stories to Watch.By Sarah SmithApr 14 2021ADVERTISEMENTMost PopularToday's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Will DOGE Go After Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Latest Moonshot?Today's MarketNIO Stock: What Is the Huge Nio Catalyst Coming on April 15?Today's MarketDogecoin Price Predictions: Where Does Red-Hot DOGE Go After Record High?Today's MarketCoinbase IPO: Can COIN Stock Really Hit $600 After Its April 14 IPO?Hot StocksCruising May Resume Too Late to Save Carnival StockADVERTISEMENTContact UsHelpCareersAdvertise With UsDisclosures & DisclaimersPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCA PolicyFinancial Market Data powered by FinancialContent Services Inc.
