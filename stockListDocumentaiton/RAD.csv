The drugstore retailer is likely to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.86 billion suggesting a 2.4% increase from the prior-year quarter\xe2\x80\x99s reported figure of $5.73 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 6 cents whereas it reported a loss of 37 cents in the year-ago quarter. Notably the consensus mark has been stable in the past 30 days.For fiscal 2021 the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24 billion suggesting a rise of 9.4% from the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s reported figure of $21.9 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\xe2\x80\x99s 2021 earnings is pegged at 67 cents implying significant growth of 346.7% from 15 cents reported last year.In the last reported quarter the drugstore retailer delivered a substantial earnings beat. Notably the company has an earnings surprise of 1033.8% on average for the trailing four quarters.Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRite Aid Corporation price-eps-surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteRite Aid has been gaining from a rise in pharmacy sales robust online performance and the expansion of services to its customers. Solid growth in prescription deliveries driven by free home-delivery services as well as a sturdy performance at Elixir has also been contributing to growth. Notably the company has been providing home service delivery to customers with an eligible prescription with the benefit of zero delivery fees. Customers can avail pick up services for prescriptions and over-the-counter products and also take advantage of the drive-through option which is available at more than 50% of its retail locations. Moreover it has launched the Buy Online Pickup In Store initiative in a bid to offer better drive-through and curbside pickup options.Apart from these Rite Aid expanded the Instacart delivery facility and received positive feedback for the same. Earlier it partnered with ScriptDrop to expedite the prescription delivery process. Moreover the company launched Rite Aid Virtual Care driven by solid demand for Tele Health in the wake of COVID-19. Also the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to reflect gains from the solid performance in PBM in terms of mail orders. That said its new RxEvolution strategy with the help of which Rite Aid is likely to become a leader in mid-market PBM remains on track. These endeavors might have aided the top line in the quarter under review.However significant adverse impacts of COVID-19 and reduced cold cough and flu cases are likely to have taken a toll on the fiscal fourth-quarter results particularly the adjusted EBITDA. Also management in a recent update noted that unfavorable weather weighed on the company\xe2\x80\x99s supply chain which in turn hurt sales in the said quarter. Notably front-end comparable same store sales fell 5.6% in the fiscal fourth quarter. As these are high-margin products the decline in comparable same store sales negatively impacted the front-end gross profit. Further lower acute prescriptions to the tune of 14% led to a nearly 1% decline in comparable same store prescriptions. Also it has been reeling under elevated SG&A expenses stemming from COVID-19-related costs including bonuses cleaning costs pandemic sick leave and other operating expenses.Due to such downsides the company recently lowered its fiscal 2021 view. Management projected revenues to be roughly $24 billion compared with the earlier guided view of $23.9-$24.2 billion. Same store sales are forecasted to grow 3.5% year over year as compared to 3.5-4.5% expected earlier. Moreover the net loss is likely to be $90-$100 million. It expected adjusted EBITDA of $425-$435 million down from $490-$520 million guided earlier.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Rite Aid this time around.

Shares took a beating in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s trading session after the biotech company announced the departure of CEO John F. Thero. Thero who will retire on August 1 has been with Amarin for twelve years and at the helm for the last seven. Karim Mikhail will take over his role. Mikhail is currently the head of commercial for Europe and joined Amarin in 2020. Mikhail held various executive roles at Merck and has considerable expertise in bringing to market lipid therapies in the EU. Between 2014 and 2018 Mikhail acted as global commercial leader in charge of all key details for Merck\'s $4 billion lipid franchise. At Amarin Mikhail has overseen the European pre-launch and commercialization of VAZKEPA - the company\xe2\x80\x99s high triglyceride treatment - which was granted regulatory approval in Europe on March 30. Amarin is gearing up for a big commercial push in the region with Germany anticipated as the first port of call for the launch. The European team numbers around 50 at present which Amarin hopes to boost up to 200 by the end of the year. Northland analyst Carl Byrnes thinks the drug could be a success in the region. \xe2\x80\x9cThe market opportunity in the EU for VAZKEPA is sizeable\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne noted \xe2\x80\x9cAs cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the EU equating to an economic burden exceeding \xe2\x82\xac210B. We approximate peak sales potential of VAZKEPA in the EU to readily exceed \xe2\x82\xac2B reflecting premium pricing and unmet medical need.\xe2\x80\x9d Overall Byrnes is bullish on Amarin\xe2\x80\x99s prospects; his $15 price target suggests gains of 182% over the coming months. The analyst has an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on the shares. (To watch Byrnes\xe2\x80\x99 track record click here) Most of Byrnes\xe2\x80\x99 colleagues agree. Based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds Amarin qualifies with a Strong Buy consensus rating. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of upside projected too; At $10.43 the average price target implies 12- month gains of 105%.

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h agoBenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h agoReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2History A2ZWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdEpic Clothing Fails That Are Too Good To Be TrueHard to believe these clothing fails actually exist BloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider.

Market Price: $19.14. Research Publication...Rite Aid (RAD) Price Target Starts at $11 Stay Away at All Cost -Skip to contentRite Aid (RAD) Price Target Starts at $11 Stay Away at All CostApril 13 2021Alex ChoCEO l Research Director[email\xc2\xa0protected]Jesse SpenceAssociate Analyst[email\xc2\xa0protected]Shakeel StewartColumnist and AuthorCOVERAGE INITIATION: Rite-Aid (RAD)Stock Rating: SELLPrice Target: 11.26 (-41% downside 12-months)Market Price: $19.14Research Publication Date: 4/13/2021We anticipate abnormal weather to have an adverse impact on Rite Aid (RAD) stock which in turn reasserts our negative stance on the company as we anticipate a more normal environment to reduce long-term growth estimates whereas near-term headwinds to sales will trigger selling in the stock following the announcement of quarterly earnings on April 15th 2021.We are initiating coverage on Rite Aid at sell as we anticipate a number of events such as snowstorms COVID-19 runoff and solvency to diminish the stock valuation in the immediate 12-month timeframe. Notwithstanding the concerns tied to the business and the scope of downside tied to these conditions we see some positives tied to the business as the company has been able to demonstrate some resiliency in this business environment though we do not anticipate this counter-cyclical retail trend to continue much longer.Furthermore the company had announced in various earningsreleases and press releases the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. We do notanticipate this to have enough of a positive effect on store traffic to resultin similar sales comps from prior year as lockdowns from March of 2020resulted in a captive customer demographic. However concerns tied to anotherlockdown has diminished considerably and based on some of our politicalsources the likelihood of another lockdown is highly improbable whichdiminishes the prospective upside tied to \xe2\x80\x9cessential retailers\xe2\x80\x9d who wouldbenefit from another lockdown.We also took into consideration the abnormal weather patterns witnessed this past winter and based on various quantitative models we anticipate holiday sales will likely disappoint given the scope of snowstorms and where the snowstorms had occurred in relation to Rite Aid\xe2\x80\x99s store footprint which in turn implies a miss and estimate reduction quarter. Recent news also suggests that the vaccine rollout for the general population will depend on pre-existing vaccination efforts at various vaccination sites outside of convenience store chains like Rite-Aid CVS and Walgreens.Furthermore Rite-Aid provided some immediate guidance on the upcoming quarter by releasing some early data as well:Front-end comparable same store sales declined approximately 5.6 percentin the quarter ended February 27 2021 driven by a decline of nearly37 percent in cough cold and flu related categories. The decline inthese categories had a disproportionately negative impact on front-endgross profit as these are comprised of higher margin products.Comparable same store prescriptions declined approximately 1.0 percentdriven by an over 14 percent decline in acute prescriptions. The Companyalso incurred incremental COVID related SG&A expenses due to a onetime hero-pay bonus cleaning costs pandemic sick leave and otherincremental operating costs.What has supported the bullish thesis the most thus far hasbeen rumors of M&A activity but with the failed WBA-RAD merger RADunloaded 1932 retail stores after years of negotiating with the FTC due toanti-trust regulation back in 2018. Basically what is left (2464 stores)after the sale of stores has been a \xe2\x80\x9ctransformative effort\xe2\x80\x9d to turnaround thebusiness but very rarely does this result in meaningful revenue/earningsaccretion in the retail brick-and-mortar space as witnessed by countlessretailers renovating stores only to go bankrupt years later.Therefore we do not anticipate much of an appetite forbrick-and-mortar acquisitions and given the scope of debt on RAD\xe2\x80\x99s balancesheet we do not see a whole lot of appetite for a leveraged buyout either asthe amount of debt would make it prohibitive for a private equity firm togenerate their return targets after gutting the business. Not to mention the difficultyof finding a buyer in this environment following an LBO reduces the likelihoodof RAD going private via a private equity transaction thus reasserting theshort thesis on the stock.We initiate coverage on Rite-AID at SELL with a PT of $11. At a high level we anticipate the company to report revenue of $5.725B for Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 which compares to analyst expectations of $5.9B revenue. We estimate FY\xe2\x80\x9921 revenue of $23.85B which compares to consensus expectations of $23.98B. In terms of GAAP Dil. EPS we estimate a Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 loss of -$0.86 and non-GAAP EPS loss of $-0.36 for Q4\xe2\x80\x9921. This compares to consensus expectations of non-GAAP losses of $-0.55. The material difference in top-line and bottom-line comps for Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 versus consensus is mostly driven by the more difficult retail environment due to snowstorms.Snowstorms have an adverse impact on Rite-AidFigure 1. Weather Impact on Retail Sales StudySource: Journal of Retailing and Consumer ServicesBased on the above study illustrated in Figure 1. theimpact of abnormal weather was measured across a broad retail basket andadjusted for weather as a causal/correlative factor to retail foot traffic andin extension retail sales. When it pertains to the full model which factors ina number of datapoints not captured by linear regression the impact of weatheron daily retail sales has been on average -17% across the study (wintermonths).However what is surprising is that the current analyst consensus anticipates +3% sales growth y/y for the holiday quarter but after RAD announced the preliminary data consensus estimates revised lower to +1.4% sales growth. Analyst estimates are mostly consistent with management guidance. Investors have to questions whether or not management could have anticipated abnormal weather conditions and the answer is a resounding no. Most weather models do not offer predictive value by more than 7 days and unfortunately historical weather patterns do not offer much predictive value to fringe case scenarios where winter storms tear through Central United States and even into the gulf states like Texas.What makes comps difficult has to do with the scope ofsnowstorm events in Holiday Quarter 2021-22 versus Holiday Quarter 2019-2020.The number of snowstorm events this year has increased to 5 major events asmeasured by the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) from the National Centers forEnvironmental Information. Whereas in 2019-2020 holiday quarter the number ofsnowstorm events were concentrated in November and September totaling to threemajor snow events. This clearly demonstrates a meaningful increase in thenumber of snowstorms as measured by the \xe2\x80\x9cFujita Scale.\xe2\x80\x9dFigure 2. Texas Snowstorms Tears Through Central UnitedStatesSource: National Centers for Environmental InformationFigure 3. Texas Snowstorms from February 13th\xe2\x80\x93February 16th (continued)Source: National Centers for Environmental InformationFigure 4. Northeast Snowstorms from January 30th\xe2\x80\x93February 3rdSource: National Centers for Environmental InformationFigure 5. Northeast Snowstorms from December 30th \xe2\x80\x93 January 3rd (continued)Source: National Centers for Environmental InformationFigure 7. Mid-West & Northeast Snowstorms fromDecember 14th \xe2\x80\x93 December 18thSource: National Centers for Environmental InformationKeep in mind the number of snow events have increasedconsiderably from prior year where there were three major recorded snow eventsin 2019 according to the NCEI Indexes. To have a substantial impact on retailsales the weather has to be abnormally bad whereby snowfall of 6\xe2\x80\x9d-12\xe2\x80\x9d couldbe significant enough to affect driving conditions close stores and lead todisaster declarations from State Governors. For example Andrew Cuomo (Gov-NY)in a series of executive orders declared a state of emergency due tosnowstorms as part of Executive Order Number 209 from February 1st2021 to March 3rd 2021. The reason why this is pertinent has muchto do with Rite-Aid\xe2\x80\x99s stores in New York State where we anticipate meaningfulsales headwinds from the sheer amount of snow.So the severity of these storms could cause a number of outcomes. In some cases the travel becomes so prohibitive to a point where road closures and various other disaster responses leads to consumers staying-in as opposed to going out shopping. Furthermore given the winter storms we anticipate that more retail activity has transitioned to e-commerce or online stores for various deliveries with the inclusion of prescription medications where Amazon launched Amazon Pharmacy as of November 2020. The emergence of Amazon could negatively affect Pharmacy Benefit Managers or PBMs such as Rite-Aid and so the scope of growth tied to this initiative could be more subdued as consumers may avoid going to RAD store locations to pick-up prescriptions.Figure 8. Quantifying the Impact on StoresSource: Cho ResearchWhen measuring the impact of Holiday sales we carefullymodel the implied impact based on the number of severe weather days whichtotaled 23 days for the prior quarter. However we do not anticipate thatmanagement outlook or analyst estimates embed these considerations into theirfinancial models which is why we estimate the average daily sales impact on aper store level for those affected in the North East/Great Lakes region andsubtract sales by -17% on those days across the affected stores (appx. 1696)which is consistent with historical impact of severe winter weather on retailsales.We then subtract our anticipated impact by month based onthe number of affected stores versus what is embedded into the averageconsensus revenue figure. We anticipate that weather contributed to anet-difference in sales vs. consensus estimates of -175.74M which is why webelieve RAD will report fall below consensus expectations heading into Aprilearnings report as illustrated in the figure below.Figure 9. Implied Impact on February Quarter EarningsSource: Cho ResearchRite Aid is already starting the year awfully as outlook suggested that revenue would grow by +3.5% y/y. However with the severe weather we anticipate that the company will report -0.10% y/y sales growth in Q4\xe2\x80\x9921. The consensus is expecting revenue growth of +0.9% for the next fiscal year but even these figures might have to be revised lower due to unusual seasonal impact and while RAD\xe2\x80\x99s management team may attempt to play off the quarterly results by reasserting growth in other areas of the business\xe2\x80\xa6 it is hard to ignore the seasonal weather impact and the eventual normalization of sales post-Pandemic. Revenue growth will return to normal as opposed to the essential retailer environment that had inflated RAD\xe2\x80\x99s sales results for the bulk of 2020.Return to a normal business environment bad for RADshareholders but good for everyone elseWith vaccinations ramping-up in the United States and moresubdued demand for healthcare services on aggregate (with the exception ofCOVID-19 related in-patient activity) it has become increasingly obvious thatsustaining growth vs. difficult comps seems less likely over the next12-months.The recent selloff was also driven by a recentnews report from MarketWatch which reported 100 vaccine distributions perweek in 5 states. The slow rollout of vaccinations suggests that the currentBiden Administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t relying on conventional retail brick-and-mortarchannels to drive herd immunity. Furthermore we anticipate that the hypeassociated with store visits tied to general population vaccinations should bemore subdued as retail locations are \xe2\x80\x9cpublic places\xe2\x80\x9d where the virus can betransmitted more easily. Hence following that logic it would be morepractical to leverage the pre-existing drive-through vaccination centers wherethere is less human contact and as a result less of a likelihood of spreadingthe COVID-19 virus.Despite the negative outlook tied to the retail storefrontrollout its worth noting that some of this retail activity could transitionover into the next quarter which is why analyst consensus estimates are moreinflated for the May 2021 quarter.As of March 8th 2021 the vaccinated population with at least one dose has increased to a total of 50.7M people according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At this point even without the use of brick-and-mortar locations roughly 1 out of 6 Americans were still able to receive a dose. So we anticipate that the vaccination effort from various drug chains will take more of a backseat when compared to various vaccination centers which continue to ramp-up front-line volunteers and source large volumes of vaccination doses vs. drug store chains.Also we anticipate that outside of the conventionaldistribution channels (vaccination centers) there has been some headlineactivity of vaccine distribution but the allocations were mostly dedicated toCVS and Walgreens (RAD\xe2\x80\x99s larger competitors). Of the allotment of dosages CVS wasonly able to procure 250000 dosages of which 81900 went to Californiapharmacies as of February 10th 2021. Similarly Walgreens announcedan allotment of 49140 doses for California in February which does not movethe needle much in terms of store traffic. In comparison RAD was not givenmuch of an allotment of vaccinations as they announced an allotment of 100vaccine doses per week for California Michigan New Jersey OhioPennsylvania and New York. The differences in numbers for the allotments isoverwhelmingly obvious and it is why we do not anticipate this activity todrive much of a revenue beat in 1H\xe2\x80\x9922.Though we anticipate the 100/week dosage figure to improveit is likely that Walgreens and CVS will get much larger allotments during thegeneral population phase and that more mature vaccination sites will get farmore vehicle/foot traffic than store-based vaccinations. We also anticipatethat a number of other negative factors like the phased re-opening ofnon-essential businesses in New York and California to have an even morecompounded negative impact on sales comps as consumer attitudes shift towardsother brick-and-mortar activities like dining movies events and specialty/apparelretail.Figure 11. Historical Sales Trends vs. Implied Impact ofEssential BusinessSource: Cho ResearchWhen basing historical revenue trends on linear regression sales for FY\xe2\x80\x9921 (ending February 31st 2022) would have been appx. $22.159B vs. $23.98B (consensus). However given the essential business designation and the captive customer base during the lockdown and increased retail foot traffic we anticipate that COVID-19 positively impacted FY\xe2\x80\x9921 sales by +$1.9B vs. linear-regression implying +$231.6M revenue for FY\xe2\x80\x9921.However upon the lifting of various COVID-19 restrictions across the United States most notably New York and California we anticipate a reversion to historical sales comp growth or really a return to normal. The normalization scenario implies a return to much slower growth (basically 0.5%-1.5% annual revenue growth) but only after a period of some customer attrition. Also as illustrated in our weather model for upcoming quarterly results we anticipate Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 revenue to decline y/y by a very marginal factor but well below current guidance/consensus expectations.Both California and New York are further easing restrictionson public venues from April 1st 2021 and April 2nd2021 respectively. These two states have also instituted revisions to dine-ineating as well where restaurants in New York can expand to half capacity forindoor dining from March 19th 2021 onwards. Whereas differentcities in California have loosened restrictions on indoor dining with SanFrancisco loosening restrictions from March 3rd 2021 onwards whereasLos Angeles County is expected to loosen restrictions on dining from March 15th2021 onwards.Because RAD has 859 locations between CA and NY the impactfrom reopening will translate to a shift in purchase intent or basically\xe2\x80\xa6customers may opt to spend money elsewhere as consumer attitudes change inresponse to the less restrictive measures. Also because CA and NY are amongthe slowest States to loosen restrictions we anticipate that the impact onsame store sales will be more noticeable in Q2\xe2\x80\x9921 and Q3\xe2\x80\x9921.Financial Model OverviewAt a high level we anticipate the company to report revenue of $5.725B for Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 which compares to analyst expectations of $5.8B revenue. We estimate FY\xe2\x80\x9921 revenue of $23.85B which compares to consensus expectations of $23.98B. In terms of GAAP Dil. EPS we estimate a Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 loss of -$0.86 and non-GAAP EPS loss of $-0.36 for Q4\xe2\x80\x9921. This compares to consensus expectations of non-GAAP losses of $-0.55.Figure 12. Financial ModelSource: Cho ResearchFor FY\xe2\x80\x9921 we expect the company to report GAAP EPS of \xe2\x80\x93$2.39 and Non-GAAP EPS of $0.26. The non-GAAP EPS compares to consensus estimates of $0.09 for FY\xe2\x80\x9921. We expect a significant earnings miss driven by a more difficult winter environment which is why we\xe2\x80\x99re below consensus expectations by -$0.23 for FY\xe2\x80\x9921.When we roll estimates forward into FY\xe2\x80\x9922 we\xe2\x80\x99re alsoanticipating a modest drop-off of revenue in 2H\xe2\x80\x9922 of -2% to account for lostcustomer traffic due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions where even withaggressive customer retention activity (appx. 80% of incremental purchaseactivity) we expect prior-year sales comps to be too difficult to beat.Furthermore we are forecasting sales of $6.114B and$6.086B for Q1\xe2\x80\x99FY\xe2\x80\x9922 and Q2\xe2\x80\x99FY\xe2\x80\x9922 respectively. We have included the impactfrom vaccinations in 1H\xe2\x80\x9922 which is why our estimates are a bit more elevatedin Q1\xe2\x80\x9922 when compared to consensus expectations of $6.05B by +$64M. We alsoforecast FY\xe2\x80\x9922 revenue of $23.786B which compares to consensus expectations of$24.29B which is below consensus expectations by -$522M. This is mostly drivenby customer attrition due to diminished carry-forward demand as restrictions onother brick-and-mortar businesses ease across CA and NY.Our FY\xe2\x80\x9922 non-GAAP dil. EPS estimate of $0.46 compares to consensus expectations of $0.82 we\xe2\x80\x99re below consensus expectations by -$0.36 wherethe drop-off in sales drives our bottom line comps to consensus considerably lower. However we anticipate that amortization related charges will continue to decline whereas restructuring expenses will remain more elevated in response to a weaker sales environment. The consensus estimate range for non-GAAP dil. EPS is $2.21 to -$0.55. Hence expectations around non-GAAP dil. EPS for the next 12-month period has a lot of variance and its mostly driven by the convoluted run-off of various adjustment items as illustrated in our financial model above.Valuation ModelFigure 13. Rite-Aid Price Target SummarySource: Cho ResearchWhen evaluating the valuation of Rite Aid we rely on our financial model methodology which has proven to be more accurate than many other methods published elsewhere. Notwithstanding we believe RAD\xe2\x80\x99s valuation is somewhere between algo-driven valuations based on implied earnings growth and historical multiples in the space. We average those two assumptions to arrive at a blended valuation of $11.26 after factoring a 6.44% discount to our forward valuation which results in a valuation that\xe2\x80\x99s 24.45x FY\xe2\x80\x9922 non-GAAP EPS of $0.46. Our discount rate is based on WACC with key inputs of $3.21B debt $674M equity 6.2% cost of debt (based on the blended interest rates of secured/unsecured notes) 13.5% cost of equity and a corporate tax rate of 20%.As illustrated we anticipate the stock to drop by -41% from its present valuation. The bull/bear thesis favors bears based on empirical data points and while there\xe2\x80\x99s some room for surprises this yearwe anticipate that capturing customers who have other dine-out options will become more difficult in FY\xe2\x80\x9922. Despite our slightly inflated non-GAAP dil. EPS metrics we believe a sequence of earnings/sales misses are in the cards and as a consequence the stock will perform poorly in response to these negative headwinds. We believe that weakness in sentiment is already captured in our financial model.As such we have assigned a sell rating on Rite Aid as weakness in business fundamentals due to unusual weather and conflated expectations tied to vaccinations will lead to expectation misses thus diminishing the valuation considerably from current levels. Furthermore our estimate captures the impact from some customer attrition following further loosening of COVID-19 restrictions in 2H\xe2\x80\x9922.Solvency RisksFigure 14. Debt MaturitySource: Rite-AidThe greatest concern for shareholders isn\xe2\x80\x99t solvency in theimmediate near-term however there\xe2\x80\x99s a loaded debt repayment schedule of $2.25Bin CY\xe2\x80\x9923 which is only two years away. As we had illustrated we don\xe2\x80\x99tanticipate meaningful revenue growth or margin expansion so the scope of riskhas much to do with the perception of financials where even a positive marginprofile on an adjusted basis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily translate to an aggressivedebt paydown schedule. Furthermore because the business doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce muchin the way of FCF $50M-$100M (2021 management guidance) there\xe2\x80\x99s not much cashto pay-off its debt schedule. This basically means that when CY\xe2\x80\x9923 rollsaround RAD will have to rollover debt or basically borrow money to replacedebt in CY\xe2\x80\x9923.This really reduces the attractiveness of RAD from anM&A perspective as a company would have to absorb $3.21B debt on top ofpaying an acquisition premium of 25%-50% to the current market cap whichtranslates to a market cap of $1.56B + debt of $3.21B translating to $4.77Btotal acquisition related charges not including underwriting fees. One couldargue that an acquirer or company could keep the debt but generally speakingreturns in private equity are contingent on leveraging cheaper debt to replacemore expensive debt however\xe2\x80\xa6 with debt being so high in relation to thecompany\xe2\x80\x99s market cap there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly any rationale for acquiring the company ascleaning the balance sheet doesn\xe2\x80\x99t translate to much of a FCF improvement thusdiminishing the scope of accretion. If not private equity a larger retailerwould have to absorb more debt thus diminishing their credit profile in anenvironment where debt rating agencies are highly skeptical of retailers.This diminishes the risks of shorting the stock due toM&A driven chatter as it\xe2\x80\x99s an awful acquisition target and has alreadybeen hamstrung in the past due to FTC involvement pertaining to Anti-Trust. Sowithout a suitable buyer and without the ability to generate immediate FCFgrowth from a leveraged buyout there\xe2\x80\x99s also a low likelihood that RAD wouldattract private equity suitors as well.Trading the StockFigure 15. Price Chart 1-YearSource: Google FinanceThe stock is trending lower following the release of negative data several weeks ago. The hype is dissipating in the stock and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really well substantiated whatsoever and as various datapoints start to price-in to the stock that the price is poised to capitulate following the announcement of next quarter earnings. The stock rode a trend on what\xe2\x80\x99s been a fortuitous FY\xe2\x80\x9921 but as we had illustrated in our historical revenue model and COVID-19 restrictions contribution to retail sales the business is poised to return to normalized growth trends with some attrition in customer demand and as a consequence it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to sustain an inflated multiple without the corresponding growth metrics to back it up.Figure 16. Price Chart 5-YearSource: Google FinanceTherefore we anticipate that as growth normalizes thestock will return back to earth as a more mature earnings profile will clearlyexpose RAD shareholders to its historical pattern of price volatility asillustrated above in the 5-year price chart. Also even with rumors of M&Aspeculation and the eventual sale of stores to WBA (Walgreens Boots Alliance)the stock continued to trend lower following the sale of 1932 stores to WBA in2018 as the underlying business fundamentals continued to deteriorate evenwith the announcement of accelerated share repurchases and debt reduction.In the end RAD ended up with even more debt a couple yearslater and the share buybacks did little in the near-term to keep the stockafloat. Aside from the recent spate of good luck due to COVID-restrictionswhere convenience stores outperformed many other retailers the return tonormal also spells impending disaster where stagnant growth metrics andinflated multiples in the space translates to valuation compression and littlein the way of M&A interest.Final ThoughtsWE INITIATE COVERAGE ON RITE AID AT SELL our PT of $11.26 implies -41% downside from owning the stock due to a more normal retail environment and immediate weather-related headwinds to Q4\xe2\x80\x9921 results. While other retailers/restaurants likely benefit from easing of COVID-19 restrictions the back-half impact from diminished purchase intent due to wallet share shifting to other brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce will translate to a miss and revise lower environment.As such we think investors should avoid the stock or lock-in profits before the rest of the street catches onto the reversal in business fundamentals following the announcement of more conservative guidance or other analysts revise estimates lower in response to a shifting retail environment and weather-related impact. Furthermore the re-emergence of specialty retail and various other laggards due to COVID-19 restrictions will also shift asset flows to other small cap peers in the space that weren\xe2\x80\x99t net beneficiaries from the restricted retail environment.Disclosure: Cho Research was not compensated by Rite Aid to publish\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c Rite Aid (RAD) Price Target Starts at $11 Stay Away at All Cost\xe2\x80\x9dThoughwe may enter into a short position following publication of this report or affiliates of Cho Research may be short Rite Aid currently.Cho Research does use the research dollars it generates from otherclients of our research service to fund market researchreports suchas this along with advertising.

Over the weekend for example I checked out the debut episode of The Nevers a fun new HBO Max original series set in Victorian London. In it a group of mostly women are \xe2\x80\x9ctouched\xe2\x80\x9d with extraordinary powers and abilities -- one of whom played by Laura Donnelly is an absolute beast in hand-to-hand combat even while wearing a restrictive period dress -- and viewers apparently agreed with me. The show delivered the biggest debut audience ever for the inaugural episode of an HBO Max original series. From there we could talk about the other major streamers that have blockbuster content on the way like Netflix -- which just renewed its smash-hit Bridgerton for a third and fourth season. Also Netflix is dropping a new season this summer of Lupin its French-language original series about a gentleman thief that quickly became one of the streamer\xe2\x80\x99s biggest shows of all time. And Disney+ has some massive series teed up for release like Season 1 of Loki coming this summer. Having pointed to all these though we should note that for some people it\'s still too easy to overlook one of the relatively newer streaming players: Apple TV+. And here is why you absolutely shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Self Financial decided to take a closer look at all the streamers to analyze which ones actually give you the best bang for your buck -- in terms of things like value and the quality of content on offer. Here are some of the findings its study produced relative to Apple TV+: AppleTV+ has highest average IMDb score for its titles (7.24) but has fewer than 70 titles to choose from. Apple TV+ also has more 4K HDR content than HBO Max and higher average quality (7.13 IMDb) than Netflix (6.94) Disney+ (6.63) and HBO Max (7.01). Apple TV+\xe2\x80\x99s animated offering is higher quality than Disney+\'s (5.96 vs 5.88) but lacks the quantity. Apple TV+ has higher-rated family-friendly content than Netflix Disney+ and Prime Video. "For the quantity of content you get for your subscription price Netflix\xe2\x80\x99s library is unmatched" the study notes with the full results available to check out here. "It is over three times the size of its nearest competitor HBO Max which charges a flat $14.99/month offering no \xe2\x80\x98basic\xe2\x80\x99 option like the rest. "But value for money shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be judged by the pure quantity of content available to viewers. It needs to factor in the quality of titles we are able to stream." Apple CEO Tim Cook himself made these same points in his podcast interview a few days ago with The New York Times\' Kara Swisher. For the iPhone maker he stressed Apple TV+ "is not a hobby. It is not a dip-your-toe-in ... We\'re about making the best (TV) not the most." On a related note here are some upcoming Apple TV+ releases to put on your calendar: Debuting this Friday April 16 on Apple TV+ is The Year Earth Changed. It\'s a roughly 40-minute documentary narrated by David Attenborough with incredible footage from around the world showing how the planet and specifically nature adapted to humans going into lockdown stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. On April 30 Apple TV+ is getting a new TV drama series: The Mosquito Coast (I\'ll be having a full review/advance look at this series coming later this week). It stars Justin Theroux and Melissa George. The dynamic in this show involves an American family on the run into Mexico fleeing American authorities -- and dodging cartel baddies along the way -- because of something Justin\'s character did stemming from his work with the NSA. On June 4 Lisey\'s Story starring Julianne Moore and based on a novel from Stephen King will debut on Apple TV+. And the 6-part docu-series Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson is coming on July 30. Apple Original Films on Tuesday also announced that it\'s green-lit a documentary about jazz musician Louis Armstrong called Black & Blues: The Colorful Ballad of Louis Armstrong from Brian Grazer and Ron Howard\xe2\x80\x99s Imagine Documentaries.13h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Red Gobo | Search AdsWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdCost of Luxury Cruises in 2021 Is Turning HeadsCruise Prices In 2021 May Make Your Jaw Drop ReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamCoinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.5h agoReutersCoinbase listing marks latest step in crypto\'s march to the mainstreamLONDON (Reuters) -Coinbase Global Inc the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange will list on the Nasdaq on Wednesday marking a milestone in the journey of virtual currencies from niche technology to mainstream asset.The listing is by far the biggest yet of a cryptocurrency company with the San Francisco-based firm saying last month that private market transactions had valued the company at around $68 billion this year versus $5.8 billion in September.It represents the latest breakthrough for acceptance of cryptocurrencies an asset class that only a few years ago had been shunned by mainstream finance according to interviews with investors analysts and executives.9h agoReutersGold prices ease as equities rally outweighs softer dollarGold prices inched lower on Wednesday as a record rally in global equity markets offset support for bullion from a softer dollar and data showing a jump in U.S. inflation.Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1743 per ounce as of 1013 GMT."Gold reacted positively to the U.S. inflation data because bond yields were down and the dollar was also weaker and so that certainly lend support to gold" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.11h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2TRDR VenturesWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdAndrews New Pick Is A Must For Your 2021 PortfolioAndrews top company pick for 2021... and why it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a boom year for investors.

Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h agoReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Life Insurance CoverWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdBrits Rush To Take Out Up To \xc2\xa3291k Life Insurance*Cheaper life insurance policies are available now.

That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel.

The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

CoinDeskBitcoin Analysts Set Sights on $70K (Even $80K) After All-Time HighBitcoin is seen rising towards $70K by May according to several analysts interviewed by CoinDesk.17h agoReutersLearn from Alibaba penalty China warns internet firmsChina\'s market regulator fresh from fining e-commerce giant Alibaba $2.75 billion said on Tuesday it warned nearly three dozen internet companies to stop using any banned practices such as forcing vendors to use their platform exclusively.The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it summoned 34 companies including Tencent ByteDance and JD.com for a meeting where it ordered them to conduct self-inspections within one month warning of"severe punishment" for any that still violated the rules.In February China issued new anti-monopoly guidelines targeting internet platforms.1d agoBloombergTikTok Founder\'s $60 Billion Fortune Places Him Among The World\'s Richest People(Bloomberg) -- Just last year the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable startup ByteDance Ltd. was being squeezed from all sides.The Trump administration wanted the Chinese firm which owns the ubiquitous TikTok video-sharing platform to get rid of assets. Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of \xe2\x80\x9cdelaying satisfactions\xe2\x80\x9d as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company\xe2\x80\x99s ninth anniversary celebration last month.\xe2\x80\x9cKeep an ordinary mind that\xe2\x80\x99s something that sounds easy but important to do\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPut in the plainest words when hungry eat when tired sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d(Adds latest on China crackdown in ninth paragraph)For more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.13h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2History A2ZWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdEpic Clothing Fails That Are Too Good To Be TrueHard to believe these clothing fails actually exist ReutersCredit Suisse identifies $2.3 billion of exposed assets in Greensill-linked fundsCredit Suisse has identified $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties in its Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds it told investors on Tuesday.Switzerland\'s second-biggest bank has been reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management within a month.Its asset management unit was forced last month to shut $10 billion of supply chain finance funds that invested in bonds issued by Greensill after the UK firm lost credit insurance coverage shortly before filing for insolvency.1d agoBloombergInvestors Dump Commodities as Supercycle Call Meets Skepticism(Bloomberg) -- Net bullish wagers on rising commodity prices fell to the lowest since December last week raising questions about the commodity supercycle.Money managers are trimming what had been the largest wager for rising commodity prices in at least a decade as stumbling economic reopening efforts force a reconsideration of the popular recovery trade. A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d agoCoinDeskWhat Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s Rise Says to the WorldCoinbase\'s listing on Nasdaq sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the U.S. crypto community as well as to the crypto-curious in the traditional financial sector.1d agoMore Stories', b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-technology-solutions-inc-130000876.html'

ReutersGold prices ease as equities rally outweighs softer dollarGold prices inched lower on Wednesday as a record rally in global equity markets offset support for bullion from a softer dollar and data showing a jump in U.S. inflation.Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1743 per ounce as of 1013 GMT."Gold reacted positively to the U.S. inflation data because bond yields were down and the dollar was also weaker and so that certainly lend support to gold" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.11h agoReutersTaiwan says its chip firms will adhere to new U.S. rules blacklisting China supercomputing entitiesTaiwan said on Wednesday its chip companies will adhere to U.S. rules after Washington added seven Chinese supercomputing entities last week to an economic blacklist and after a Taipei-based chipmaker halted orders from one of the entities named.The U.S. Commerce Department said the seven Chinese entities were "involved with building supercomputers used by China\'s military actors its destabilizing military modernisation efforts and/or weapons of mass destruction programs."Companies or others listed on the U.S. Entity List are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers.11h agoThe TelegraphBernie Madoff financier behind world\'s biggest Ponzi scheme dies in prisonFinancier Bernie Madoff who was sentenced to 150 years in jail after pleading guilty to organising the world\'s biggest investing scam has died in prison aged 82. Madoff died at the Federal Medical Center in Butner North Carolina from natural causes the Associated Press reported. His death comes just over a year after he asked a US judge for early release saying he was suffering from terminal kidney failure and other health problems and had 18 months to live. The request which was rejected came after he served 10 years for defrauding some of the world\'s richest investors of about $19bn (\xc2\xa313.7bn). Madoff had been a favourite among investors after building a reputation as a star stock-picker who delivered steady returns. However after the 2008 financial crisis when clients began asking for their money back it was revealed that he had been using inflows to pay "profits" to clients. A sizable proportion of his victims were middle-class workers left struggling to pay bills due to the \xe2\x80\x9ccash in cash out\xe2\x80\x9d fraud.2h ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Red Gobo | Search AdsWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdCost of Luxury Cruises in 2021 Is Turning HeadsCruise Prices In 2021 May Make Your Jaw Drop ReutersWorld stocks post record highs as bond yields easeGlobal stock markets pushed to record highs on Wednesday as bond yields eased after data showed U.S. inflation was not rising too fast as the economy re-opens.With fears receding for now that a strong inflation reading might endanger the Federal Reserve\'s accommodative stance European shares were 0.2% higher.Gains were capped after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay rolling out its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe after U.S. health agencies recommended pausing its use as six women developed rare blood clots.12h agoBenzingaJ&J Covid Vaccine Pause Appears To Weigh On Airline Casino Hotel Stocks EarlyAfter a dull Monday investors awake this morning to a couple of big news items. That being said both the consumer price index (CPI) and a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s (NYSE: JNJ) Covid vaccine seem to be having a muted impact on the market. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the JNJ vaccine withdrawal but first a look at CPI: It came in at 0.6% for March up from 0.4% in February and just a bit above analysts\xe2\x80\x99 average estimate of 0.5%. The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s up isn\xe2\x80\x99t too surprising considering all the inflation warnings from the Fed lately but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see it\xe2\x80\x99s only a little above expectations. That\xe2\x80\x99s in contrast to last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s producer price index which came in way way above expectations. Maybe this will settle inflation fears a bit. The other big news is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) decision to temporarily pause use of JNJ\xe2\x80\x99s Covid vaccine due to a handful of blood clots. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t great news obviously but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing people need to go crazy over. We had good momentum with vaccinations heading into summer and this might slow the momentum but the other two vaccines are still working well. Vaccine Pause Hits Reopening Shares Also people shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of vaccines as a simple product without potential problems. No one knows yet if these blood clots are a game changer for the JNJ vaccine but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a complication got reported simply because vaccines aren\xe2\x80\x99t widgets. Like any medical product they\xe2\x80\x99re complex and can have different effects on different people. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly and the JNJ vaccine comes back. It\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of cases (six cases after 6.8 million vaccinations) and the FDA said it acted \xe2\x80\x9cout of an abundance of caution.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how long it might take to get to the bottom of this but the other vaccines were already being used millions of times a day in the U.S. and that continues. The FDA may want to examine more data before allowing JNJ to come back but in a worst-case scenario it\xe2\x80\x99s off the market for an extended period putting more pressure on supplies of the other vaccines. The JNJ pause could put some pressure on some of the \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d stocks and sectors until things get sorted out. Already this morning we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing shares of airlines casinos and cruise lines turning lower in pre-market trading. An FDA press conference scheduled for 10 a.m. ET today might grab Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Though reopening shares start the day under pressure a new JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) note suggests the economy could fully reopen by July 4. Whether this JNJ development affects that timeline is unclear but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think JPM might be right. Meanwhile volatility remains light and Bitcoin is now above $62000. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is up but still below 17.5 which is amazing when you remember how long it spent above 50 last year. Unless there\xe2\x80\x99s big news out of the FDA press conference trading could be pretty slow today as investors await tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s onslaught of big bank earnings. Summer Of 2020 Revisited? Nope you\xe2\x80\x99re not on a time machine back to last summer. Those really were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) rolling up big gains yesterday while this year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creopening\xe2\x80\x9d darlings like airlines energy companies and entertainment firms took a back seat. This was before today\xe2\x80\x99s JNJ vaccine news remember. Both NVDA and TSLA rallied on specific news with TSLA benefiting from an analyst upgrade while NVDA raised its Q1 revenue guidance and introduced several new products which actually might have weighed on shares of some of its competitors including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). NVDA and TSLA formed the vanguard Monday but for the most part stocks marched in place as investors seemed to stay on the sidelines waiting for earnings. It all starts tomorrow when we hear from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). For the first time in a while the big banks have a tailwind and investors can focus more on traditional bank functions and less on the industry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to bail out the floodwaters. The 10-year yield is much higher than it was six months ago so they can make more on the spread and that should go right to the bottom line. Beyond that trading is an important part of many bank businesses (especially some of the big Wall Street sluggers like JPM and GS) and they possibly saw benefits in their bond trading during Q1 thanks to opportunities there. As always investors should consider focusing on the separate fortunes of equities and fixed income trading where there\xe2\x80\x99s often bifurcation. Heading into earnings season FactSet projected overall S&P 500 Financial Sector (IXM) earnings to rise 78.7% year-over-year in Q1 so things are definitely looking up. In fact the average Wall Street Financial earnings forecast has risen pretty substantially even from just a month ago. The banking sector has sputtered a bit lately after a great start to the year. Energy also slowed its pace a bit. Some analysts see this as a temporary slowdown while the Treasury market continues to consolidate. If Q1 earnings and coming economic data shape up as strong as many Wall Street watchers are starting to think they will 10-year yields could start to rise again and lift the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccyclicals\xe2\x80\x9d like Financials and Energy that tend to do better in a recovering economy. Pandemic Provides The Backdrop There\xe2\x80\x99s always a caveat and here\xe2\x80\x99s one: The Covid situation isn\xe2\x80\x99t really retreating much. Average caseloads are still rising despite the great vaccine progress. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell expressed caution over the weekend telling \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the recent case spike and its possible impact on the economy. And of course there was today\xe2\x80\x99s bad news about the JNJ vaccine being paused due to blood clots. If cases keep climbing watch the other data like hospitalizations and deaths carefully. They tend to be lagging indicators and if they stay relatively tame it could mean the vaccinations are protecting some of the most vulnerable people. Leaving Covid behind for the moment FactSet pegs overall S&P 500 earnings to rise 24.5% in Q1 led by Consumer Discretionary Financials Materials and Info Tech. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors analysts see in the red with their Q1 earnings results and those are also two of the three S&P sectors expected to have falling revenue too. Typically analysts get too conservative with their estimates ahead of earnings season so FactSet factors that in and says it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely actual earnings will rise 28% when all is said and done. That would be the highest earnings growth in more than 10 years. At the high end FactSet estimated earnings could grow as much as 37.6% in Q1. Margin Call? Not Yet Some people wonder if margins might start eroding possibly due to rising costs like we saw in the producer price index (PPI) last week. So far no sign of that. S&P Global expects margins to rise this year and next. Of course the Fed keeps telling everyone that any price growth we see here is probably temporary and easy comparisons with soft year-ago inflation could over-dramatize how much things are actually going up. By later in 2021 it might be easier to get a sense not only of how transient or non-transient this inflationary pressure is but also whether the Biden administration has the ability to push through a corporate tax increase which is another thing that could potentially hurt margins. CHART OF THE DAY: CAN THE U.S. DOLLAR HANG ON? The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY\xe2\x80\x94candlestick) has generally remained within its upward channel (yellow lines) since the beginning of the year. Can it maintain this move as it skirts its support level once again? Although $DXY is moving up today it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it can\xe2\x80\x99t break below the lower channel. It could still go either way\xe2\x80\x94retest the 90 level (blue line) which was the Feb low or break above 92.5 (purple line) the early March high and resume its move within the channel. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim\xc2\xae platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The Dollar\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma: While the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) is still trading within its uptrend channel (see chart above) since Jan. of this year it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore that it is trading close to a critical support level. If it does break below the lower channel which at the moment sits at around 92.10 we could see $DXY test the 90 level the low it hit at the end of Feb or it could continue moving within its upward channel. When it comes to the U.S. dollar a lot also depends on economic fundamentals such as actions taken by the Fed and other central banks. Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish relatively speaking? Since the U.S. dollar trades against other currencies it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to know where other central banks stand with respect to interest rate decisions. It can shed some light on global economic growth outlook. Another piece of economic data to keep an eye on this week: retail sales and inflation. Both could have an impact on the U.S. dollar. Bank Earnings Net Margin and the Rate Watch: As big banks prepare to open their Q1 books this week it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on recent moves in interest rates. On the face of it the rise in long rates\xe2\x80\x94particularly when accompanied by dovish talk from the Fed about leaving short rates at the zero bound\xe2\x80\x94is the optimal setup for the banks. And sure enough over the past three months the yield spread between the 3-month Treasury and the 10-year Treasury widened by over 80 basis points to its highest level in four years\xe2\x80\x94a positive development for an industry that\xe2\x80\x99s business model is centered on borrowing (and paying deposits on) the short end and lending on the long end. But like most things economic there\xe2\x80\x99s always \xe2\x80\x9cthe other hand.\xe2\x80\x9d A nominal rise in mortgage rates all else equal should pad the bottom line of lenders. But when you consider the amount of exuberance in the housing market\xe2\x80\x94think Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN) KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and other home builders that have seen shares blow through all-time highs in the middle of a pandemic\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that rising mortgage rates could eventually eat into the balance sheets of homeowners and small businesses and to the housing market in general. Anyone who was around for the last recession knows what can happen to banks when a frothy housing market turns south. It\xe2\x80\x99s another reminder to keep a close eye on bank earnings as banks tend to be tied into the rest of the economy. For now however banks head into earnings season with the sun shining brightly. When Things Look Good People Worry: A couple things to consider here as the market finishes up its \xe2\x80\x9cbreather\xe2\x80\x9d ahead of earnings: First there\xe2\x80\x99s concern among some analysts that a couple of economic indicators like manufacturing growth and consumer confidence may be at \xe2\x80\x9ctoppy\xe2\x80\x9d levels. Manufacturing for instance is at multi-decade highs. While that may be true you can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything magical about current numbers just because they match say a level not seen since 1984. The numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t know or care what happened back in the first Reagan term. They just do what they do. A fresh University of Michigan sentiment report Friday could give more insight into any perceived \xe2\x80\x9ctoppiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Also volatility has gotten so low recently with the VIX finishing below 17 again yesterday that people are starting to worry it might go up again. This sounds like traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwall of worry\xe2\x80\x9d talk and another sign that this rally just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much respect.

Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder 38-year-old Zhang Yiming is among the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level Zhang who owns about a quarter of ByteDance could be worth more than $60 billion placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.\xe2\x80\x99s Pony Ma bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the U.S. according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It\xe2\x80\x99s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cZhang is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks\xe2\x80\x9d said Ma Rui partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is set on building an enduring global business.\xe2\x80\x9dSurging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation a person with knowledge of the matter said. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from $20 billion about three years ago according to CB Insights. But in the private market some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares people familiar have said. The company\xe2\x80\x99s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond to requests for comment.It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it\xe2\x80\x99d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been singled out as a target its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more silly games in the U.S. with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales\xe2\x80\x9d said Kirk Boodry founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell\xe2\x80\x9d he added referring to ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan Zhang the only son of civil servants studied programming at Tianjin\xe2\x80\x99s Nankai University where he built a following on the school\xe2\x80\x99s online forum by fixing classmates\xe2\x80\x99 computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating later calling the job so boring he often \xe2\x80\x9cworked half of the day and read books in the other half\xe2\x80\x9d according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012 when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app Douyin. In the process it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp. Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters Susquehanna has become ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s largest outside backer with a 15% stake according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012 when ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang who led that investment for Susquehanna\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the U.S. and India Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance\xe2\x80\x99s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc. with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang it\xe2\x80\x99s not all about immediate payoffs.

A recent bond rout raised worries over inflation and surging bulk shipping rates are seen capping any further upswing.There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have yet to get rid of the coronavirus with rising cases and extended lockdowns delaying the expected growth sprint\xe2\x80\x9d said Ole Hansen head of commodities research at Saxo Bank. \xe2\x80\x9cThe surge in Treasury yields a stronger dollar and worries that China may tighten liquidity in order to curb inflation are also contributing factors.\xe2\x80\x9dHedge funds\xe2\x80\x99 net bullish positions on a basket of 20 commodities have decreased for six weeks in a row according to the latest Commodities Futures Trade Commission and ICE data compiled by Bloomberg. That comes after money managers boosted the figure to the highest in data going back to 2011 while prices in the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index rose to nearly the highest in eight years in February.Commodities had seen a resurgence in interest early this year as major investment banks flagged the start of a new structural bull cycle -- with some even calling for a supercycle comparable to ones that peaked in the 1970s and early 2000s.The idea was that raw materials would benefit as the world emerged from the pandemic and fiscal stimulus programs would sustain a downtrend in the U.S. dollar thereby making commodities priced in the greenback more attractive. While a return to normal is anticipated hiccups in recent months surrounding economic reopening plans are clouding the near-term outlook. Meanwhile the dollar came back from its lows this year alongside rising bond yields.In the last week investor outflows were most pronounced for oil with funds weighing whether demand will be strong enough to absorb returning supply in coming months. OPEC and its allies decided earlier this month to gradually ease unprecedented output curbs from May to July while further out the market may see more Iranian supply come back if it returns to a nuclear deal.Adding further pressure volatility-targeted funds like commodity trading advisers underwent \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread deleveraging\xe2\x80\x9d after global benchmark Brent futures\xe2\x80\x99 briefly jumped above $71 a barrel following an attack on Saudi oil facilities in March Ryan Fitzmaurice commodities strategist at Rabobank said in a note Friday.Now a squeeze on vessels to carry some commodities around the world is adding another risk for investors to consider. The cost of shipping unpacked commodities like grains and iron ore known as dry bulk is up more than 50% this year.The move up in shipping costs \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it more expensive to move things around which goes contrary to the idea of a supercycle\xe2\x80\x9d Eddie Tofpik head of technical analysis and senior markets analyst at ADM Investor Services International Ltd. said at an online event last month.Still calls remain for commodities to continue their price rebound this year after this period of consolidation.\xe2\x80\x9cCommodities remain the best performing asset class of 2021\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a report Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe view this consolidation as nothing more than a fleeting speed bump created by logistical bottlenecks in vaccine roll-outs.\xe2\x80\x9dFor more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\xc2\xa92021 Bloomberg L.P.2d ago Ad\xe2\x80\xa2Life Insurance CoverWhy this Ad?I like this adI don\'t like this adAdvertise with usAdBrits Rush To Take Out Up To \xc2\xa3291k Life Insurance*Cheaper life insurance policies are available now.
